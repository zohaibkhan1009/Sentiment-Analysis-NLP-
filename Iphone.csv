Positive,"Every thing is good about iPhones, there's nothing compared to it's speed and ios but i was disappointed because there's no charger for it even though Indian judiciary told them to provide , still they haven't made any progress regarding charger. Why should we spend 62k and more than that for iPhones because of it's brand and Acessories comfort size and Features right if that's not there what's point of buying an iPhone.Thank you??"
Positive,"It look so fabulous, I am android user switched to apple, performance wise iPhone is more better than android due to A15 Bionic chip. I feel pleasant while using iPhone in hand. I like it very much ????"
Positive,"I tried to flip camera while recording but no facility is added here. You have to pause first then you can flip from back to front or vice versa it means you can't continue it, very awkward position. Iphone software should be upgraded so that we can make it go. It's very essential for a content creator. I purchased gimbal dji om se but it could not provided that, it's very essential for a vlogger but I was fed up after finding the basic requirements wasn't built in these products !"

Positive,"My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.I have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I can’t believe what I’m seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn’t disappointing.Display quality is truly flagship level and I’m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I don’t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.Speakers are Great.Battery life is better than my previous devices,iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.Truly worth it."
Positive,Nice
Positive,It’s a perfect iPhone I highly recommend this seller . Great price on their sale. The phone is good
Positive,What I like about this phone is that it is quite reasonable comparing other iphones and Is very good and nice to use.
Positive,I bought the product little expensive. Within a month price dropped by Rs.17000.
Positive,"Though we talk a lot about high price for iPhones, this is worth the amount. Smooth touch, perfect to hold in hand. For the screen size of 6.1"", it looks small overall. I could have gone for pro max but more than 1.5L budget is way too much for me :-)* Good battery back-up (With low battery mode always on, 5 hours of talk-time, around 2 hours of twitter and 2 hours of whatsapp usage, 1 hour of songs listening, 1 hour of rummy/candy crush games and notification of all these items, the battery comes for more than 24 hours for me)* Getting charged quickly from 20% to 100% within 2 hours* Perfect camera and I love that 'Live' photo option* Body design is awesome. When I held it in my hand for the first time, felt really happy about the design and the size of the iPhone 13."
Neutral,Works just fine nothing special the camera is also good but during night it's not what I expected it to be and you have to charge the phone twice if you use it a lot it also heat sometimes it it doesn't like but sometimes it doesn't feel very smooth I don't know if it's value for money
Positive,Loved it
Positive,There’s no same day delivery Phone was delivered to me in 3-4 days. I had to purchase  the phone thrice so on the third attempt I finally received the phone. Battery life is better than iPhone XR. Phone is same as shown in pictures. Amazon refund policy is good. I received both refunds within 24 hours.
Negetive,My device is not working (switched off)Iam not able to download Invoice and warranty documentHow can I get itService center asking the document
Positive,Best
Neutral,Not worth
Neutral,Nothing new features only model changed
Negetive,Seals were teared but only stricker was put. I don't know whether it is new or refurbished but it's working 
Positive,"This phone has well balanced HD oled sDisplay. Colours are accurate. Camera quality is very good even with 12 MP cameras. Selfies and portrait look good, but selfies indoor required little improvement which can be done through software. Battery back up is great. Faster transfer using Airdrop. I am getting a 1 and half day of battery backup with normal usage. Overall a perfect smartphone with ios experience."
Positive,Good not like android
Positive,Good charge
Positive,Actually I’m android user now switched to iPhone user experience is good but camera quality isn’t meet my expectations when taken photos on day times and little low lights you’ll get good quality photos. Night mode is worst. Battery is good for moderate users. Phone is very compact and display quality really awesome. My conclusion if you looking for privacy and protect from hackers definitely iPhone is safe. Those who are all moderate user and then buy this model
Positive,Very good I am happy
Positive,Works fine
Positive,Cool
Positive,"As it is an apple product, quality is ensured and proven"
Positive,My phone was bent for some reason. So kindly infirm check my warrenty period. Get me feedback
Positive,fine
Positive,"I mainly bought it for content creation because the software optimization was good and also because I use macbook air so data transfer between iphone is quicker than the android one, basically less hassle.Love the photo and video quality.It's also mostly for work than personal use. Customization is a bit hard but I also use android as primary phone so not an issue for me.Overall a good purchase for me."
Negetive,"I bought this iPhone 13 . There was a manufacturing defect as this phone doesn’tHave  personal hotspot and Airdrop . It’s blocked , not turning on . Deception . I can’t afford this . I am now in foreign , my friend bought this iPhone . I am not in a position even to return this iPhone ."
Positive,I received iPhone 13 timely.Product is working great.It improved my lifestyle  as  well.Camera quality is awesome. Battery performance is pretty good.Thanks to Amazon for your great service.
Neutral,"Facing heating issue, Battery performance is not that good. On screen 12 hrs only as of now. Hanging in between, which we didn’t expect from Apple. Look is fantastic. Small while compared to XR."
Positive,"I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!"
Positive,"I really wanted to get an iPhone and it is my first iPhone but i loved it the sound quality is great and it charges fast, the phone is a bit heavy but it looks classy the display also works well and the camera is the best ????"
Positive,"Things I liked:1. Solid Build Quality and very polished software (compared to Samsung's One UI)2. Camera:-Rear: Rear camera is pretty decent with good color accuracy in all lighting conditions. Videos are steady and smooth.3. Mic / Speakers: Mic is exceptionally well, isolates all background sounds in noisy situations. Speakers are crisp with good bass.4. Performance: This is where the phone shines, you can throw any app available on the App store and it will run it without breaking a sweat.5. Face Id works like charm, it's the best biometric phone lock out there undoubtedly.Things I wish were better:1. Battery life would have been better, I get up to 4.30 - 5 Hours SOT with mixed usage (high brightness, 1 hour calls, 2-3 hour social media, and 2 hour media playback/music)2. Charges Slow compared to my earlier Samsung. Takes almost 1.2 Hours from 20% to 80%3. Front camera is average, it fails to get correct skin tones and lighting. I keep it on default and still it produces over saturated photos.4. Dialer / phone app sucks. I am someone who makes up to 200 calls a day due to nature of my SCM work. Dialer on Samsung is far better. For unknown call you can add a note to the number in Samsung and it reflect when the person call you again, without having to save unnecessary contacts. Number pad does not detect contact unless complete number is typed."
Positive,Each and every thingLove this Product
Positive,I liked the way it was fast.
Neutral,"IOS 17.5 (current version updated from 16.6)Thw worst thing as a ios user for me that the fear of update , i heared some updates get display issues battery drain issues , god sake i doesn't had any issues from ios updates , but till i care- device  was great, super handy for me, little feeling of weight .Display - The 60Hz refresh rate didn't felt badly form me cause i am used such kind of device before. - The brightness Range is so comfortable. - The 2160p60 HDR videos in youtube give blissful experianceBattery And charging - The charging time:- i took 1Hour to charge  from 20% to 91% using apple 20w original adapter and cable without any interruption(no electricity break or disconnection ,calls etc) - Battery backup - I am mostly maintain battery in btw 20% <-> 80% so i think this may get one day backup for me ,Average 5h screen on timeThe one day backup is just a advertisemnt advertisement label usaully we use, actually a day like  events,party,outing  we use -camera ,editing app, social media app more than usual use , that day i didn't get a satisfied backup . - Little temperature warming while charging , no heating issue- battery health after 6 month 98%-battery cycle count 194  after 6 monthPerfomance - Good perfomance for video editing ,photography , social media . (I am not a gamer ) Camera-  Even though i  felt some lag or stuck screens in some third party applications - The cinematic Mode is mind Blowing . i missed 13 pro or higher varients for zooming in this mode . - Actually i really miss pro variant for the tele lens and camera features while i using this . Cost is wall for me. - The photos are nice and feature like exposure adjust and filter was good and quality photos . And the 5x zoomed photos is not good for me.it reduced the pixel quality .- The video and optical image stabilisation was mind blowing . i mostly explore on videos . it was soo good , no words other than that.AND THE BIGGEST FEAR FOR ME NOW IS IOS UPDATEi turned off the auto update at first place .i heared about DISPLAY ISSUES,HEATING ISSUES and BUGS in the ios updates for 13 and 14 series.So for expencive and established brand like apple does not fair . This is the only -ve i have to say as a reminder .Also i heared without ios update display issues are happened . Buy the way it is a hardware issue one of the display provider company's batch may show the issues . but we customers cannot identify which company provides the hardaware.I will attach my battery analytics data screnshot photo here so you can better understand how the battery is good The ordering experience in the greate indian sale was worst . I planned to buy this for 45999/- in oct7 greate indian sale offer but i got canceled then i bought for 48999 that was disppointed .As a whole i didn't recommend base models ,i felt i must have buy pro variant but for person who need ios in affordable price i recommend 13 is better than 14"

Neutral,Picture quality is fine but hanging issue
Positive,"Writing this review after using the phone for 5 months.Pros- camera clicks amazing pictures, video recording is the best I've seen in a phone so far compared to my previous phones. Stable videos with no shaking- battery life is good. Lasts an entire day with medium use. I don't game on the phone. Charging is as quick as it is with phones that use USB C.- display is soo good. So bright- built is solid, dropped phone a couple of times once with the cover and once without and not even a scratch.- listening to music and watching videos is a hot cos of how good the speakers r. Crystal clear with the right amount of bass and treble.Cons- phone is a tad heavy and using it for hrs on a stretch can result in pain in the wrist or fingersGot the phone in Diwali sale on discount so bang for buck if u ask me"

Positive,Excellent features
Positive,"When talking about phone, Apple is always costly and there are always +ve and -ve for everything.I have been using android for 10+ year and now I moved to Apple.There are lot of applications and few features which I am missing while moved to Apple. But what really impressed me is the power of its processor and capabilities.1. When Android phone comes with 6, 8, 12 GB RAM, the speed or performance is poor. At the same time with 4 GB RAM in iPhone was really powerful and mindblowing.2. When Android storage are full, the phone will response very slow. But Apple still surprised me with the performance.3. The video quality of Anroid phone gives from 48 MP is delivered from Apple's 12 MP camera, which is mesmerizing and absolutely brilliant.- The battery back up is okay, but could have improved. (As I am not using for gaming, it is okay to me)- As Apple started production in India, the price could have reduced."

Positive,"Got it for 65K on Amazon prime day. So as a lifelong android user I have switched to IOS. So will be dividing this into the pros and negs:Product red 128GBPros:1) Received genuine product from Amazon( was quite sceptic about it though)2) Built quality excellent3) Camera quality excellent. True to life color reproduction, Indoor conditions amazing, night photos are good, facial tones are very good, day clicks are amazing. In short it's an amazing exp. Selfie cam also produces very good quality images. And also no shift in dynamic range while shifting B/W wide and ultra wide cams.4) Display:- Its a really great display, not 120 hz, but the experience is no less than a 120 hz, coz of apple's great software optimization, buttery smooth, no jitters on the screen, won't feel like a 60 hz panel. Now the notch, yes it will be bothering a little bit but its got its own functions, face unlock and stuff (works great in all environmental conditions)after a little while you get adjusted and it got its own magic functions like when when the phone rings and you go close to it, it detects your presence and lowers the vol level.5) Performance: Most powerful processor in the world.6) Battery:- With light usage will easily go for 2 days and with heavy 1 day. Remember to follow a charging pattern and it will give a solid battery exp.7) Speakers: Very loud with a small thumpCons:1) To keep photos and stuff you need to buy storage. 5 GB by default but that's nothing. Download google photos as an alternate sol. if you don't wanna buy storage.2) File management system sucks, android is much better.3) It has dolby atmos but for that you need a subscription to Apple music.4) Does not have a telephoto cam, which I think is a must at this price point.5) Somehow I am not getting 4g+ on my airtel, don't know why but in my android phone always used to get that.6) No USB C7) Siri is dumb AF8) Apple maps are not good, so download Google maps.9) Google keypad is much better than apple's.10) Notification panel and those small things like typing in the notification panel and other things that you can do in android is much much better than apple.11) As of now no haptic feedback while typing maybe coming on IOS 16Note:- Apple ecosystem still exploring that part but whenever you click any pic it automatically gets updated and I can see it in my Macbook also.Overall I would say if you are planning to buy a phone for responsiveness and does the everyday stuff without any hanging problems and stuff then buy it, and also if you are planning to keep it for a long time, then I think its a good investment for the future. Its got Great resale value.Hope this helps in making your decision easier.Update after 2 weeks of usage:All the above points remains the same, but I did check out the ecosystem and the experience has been amazing.1) I can receive and make phone calls (cellular calls) from my macbook, and the call quality is also good.So basically you can keep your phone in some other section of the house and you are working with your macbook somewhere else and if some call comes you can receive that on your macbook. PS:- your phone and macbook should be connected to a similar network, i.e wi-fi.2) Airplay- Just from the lock screen itself i can play any video and also listen to music from my phone. So basically you can watch youtube amazon prime videos(app not in the macbook but present on phone) and other stuff and also listen to music, and the switch of devices is also seamless. So someone in my house can use my macbook to watch movies on amazon prime(playing from my phone) and I can browse linkedin or FB from my iphone."

Positive,"This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things."
Positive,"The iPhone 13 128GB has surpassed my expectations in every aspect, setting a new standard for smartphone excellence. From its sleek design to its powerful performance and innovative features, this device has truly redefined what it means to own a premium smartphone.Design and Build Quality:The iPhone 13’s design is a masterpiece of craftsmanship, featuring a sleek aluminum frame and a stunning ceramic shield front cover.

The IP68 water and dust resistance provide added durability and peace of mind, making it perfect for everyday use.Display:The Super Retina XDR display of the iPhone 13 is nothing short of breathtaking. The 6.1-inch OLED screen delivers vibrant colors, deep blacks, and excellent brightness levels, ensuring an immersive viewing experience for everything from streaming videos to browsing the web. The True Tone technology adapts the display to ambient lighting conditions, providing a comfortable viewing experience at all times."
Positive,"I've been using the Apple iPhone 13 (Blue) for six months now, and it's been fantastic. Here's my take:Design:The blue color looks really cool and the phone feels premium. It's sleek and comfortable to hold.Screen:The display is sharp and bright. Watching videos and scrolling through photos looks amazing.Speed:This phone is super fast. I've had no issues with lag, even when playing games or multitasking.Camera:The cameras are awesome. Photos come out clear and vibrant, and it works great in low light too. Video recording is top-notch. Battery:The battery life is solid. I get through a full day easily, even with heavy use. Fast charging is a nice plus.Software:iOS is smooth and easy to use. I love how well it works with my other Apple devices.Overall, the iPhone 13 is a great phone and I'm really happy with it. Definitely recommend it!"
Positive,"This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using Samsung S10 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5.

Positive,"After purchasing the iPhone 13, I’m genuinely impressed with its performance and features. Here’s a detailed review based on my experience:### Design and Build QualityThe iPhone 13 feels incredibly premium in hand. The flat edges and matte finish on the back give it a sleek and modern look. The build quality is top-notch, with the Ceramic Shield front adding a layer of durability that gives me confidence in its longevity.### DisplayThe 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning. The colors are vibrant, and the blacks are deep, making everything from photos to videos look fantastic. The brightness levels are impressive, and even in direct sunlight, the screen remains perfectly readable. The slightly smaller notch is a nice touch, offering a bit more screen space.### PerformanceThe A15 Bionic chip is a powerhouse.

The new Photographic Styles and Cinematic mode are fantastic additions, allowing for creative freedom and professional-looking videos.### Battery LifeBattery life has been a pleasant surprise. I easily get through a full day of use on a single charge, even with heavy usage. The efficiency of the A15 Bionic chip and the slightly larger battery make a noticeable difference compared to previous models.### SoftwareiOS 15 is smooth and intuitive. The new features like Focus modes, enhanced FaceTime capabilities, and improved privacy controls make the user experience even better. Everything feels well-integrated and easy to use.### Overall ImpressionThe iPhone 13 has exceeded my expectations. It offers a perfect balance of performance, design, and innovative features.

With moderate use, the device can easily last a full day on a single charge.

Positive,"You don't need to explain how good apple products are. My earlier iPhone was SE 2020, which worked very well. I exchanged my iPhone SE 2020 with this iPhone 13 and the phone is a wonder. Everything is flawless, speed, performance, face-ID speed.. Just perfect!!"
Positive,I’ve received refurbished item in summer sale.Apart from above comment - iPhone 13 is awesome phone .. Value for money at this price.
Positive,"Absolutely original, received brand new i phone 13, go for it."
Positive,"This phone won’t disappoint you in any aspect,whether it’s the battery life,performance or the cameras but what you might miss is a 120hz screen or perhaps a telephoto lens but if those things do not concern you then there’s actually no reason for you to not buy this, it’s the best phone if you can get it for under 50k,period."
Positive,Exchange of the product was not working
Positive,Loved it and price is best in sale.
Positive,Nothing
Positive,Nice phone and nice performance all over is good in phone ?? comparison to14 better than the 13
Positive,Product is good only thing is Amazon delivery is poor
Positive,"It is an amazing phone, the entire experience is buttery smooth although the battery is a slightly let down but cannot complain much as it has come a long way since the older iphones, it manages to give a day’s battery life with 6-7 hours screen time which is decent (depending upon how you wanna use your phone, i use mine primarily for work, emailing, googling, watching videos and all). The camera is actually great especially the video quality is wow, this is my switch from android to ios for the first time, although there are a few restrictions in terms of customisation and all but otherwise the phone is great, total value for money (got it for 62k)"
Positive,"I have been using IPhone 7 for nearly 4 years and finally decided to switch to IPhone 13. Now it’s been like nearly six months I been using this phone and I couldn’t really find a real drawback what do ever.Camera is the best. I am not exaggerating, it is better than the entry level DSLR’s. Performance, battery life, sound, display - I am so impressed.The only drawback I could see is phone is slightly heating up while playing games or charging.But it’s still worth a buy."
Neutral,"I switched from Oneplus 5t to iPhone 13. The reasons I switched was 1. Battery life of Oneplus 5t deteriorated rapidly and OnePlus hardly cared to explain this. I also suspected that OnePlus deliberately created a bug that led to sudden drop in battery life. 2. Wanted to get an Android phone but could not find even one decent phone that did not have heating issues. 3. Oneplus device also suffered from Screenburn.Having switched the battery life is sorted and the phone does not have any heating issues but iPhones lack basic features such as1. Display of date and time on status bar2. The rounded edges of the phone create a problem as some apps with options at the bottom of the screen are not properly displayed.3. Amazon App does not allow purchase if Kindle books on iOS devices.4. Typing is a problem as the screen is smaller compared to a OnePlus device.Overall, I am neither too happy nor too sad with the purchase though I must confess that price of the phone seems exorbitant vis a vis the value delivered."
Positive,Worthy of Money
Positive,After using almot 6 month this phone is running smooth as new one there is some network issues with this phone but although overall you can buy it-MG
Positive,Such a great app
Positive,Good phone according to budget................
Positive,It is better than any other premium phone which is cost more than this like s22I would recommend for who wantPerformance 10/10Camera 9/10Video 10/10Display 10/10Sound 10/10
Positive,"As a first time iPhone user, I was very confused to buy this iPhone 13 or 12 though price difference is manageable…so after all reviews and conclusion I went for iPhone 13 and now after one month usage I can say I have made very right choice. Works very well for me. Be it camera, battery , display. Everything is just perfect…after all it’s an iPhone. And I am moderate user.. so I don’t play heavy games on this device..hence with normal usage it gives me approx 1.5 days battery back up. Hope it helps to choose the right phone for you :-)"
Positive,good
Positive,Best product and camera is just awesomeBought it in sale at best price with no cost emi offerCharging is working best to its use
Positive,Awesome

Positive,Amazing camera quality.....deep details camera
Positive,I liked the phone the sound quality is insane and very fast charging the size of phone is also preety good and the display is the best I tested the performance is also very smooth and fast and very light weight phone I recommend you to buy it instead of iPhone 14.
Positive,Good quality features ??
Positive,"What do you want to hear about iPhone,if you are reading this review,it means that you have already done enough research to buy it.so, congratulations for your new iphone??"
Negetive,"It's been less than a year and I am facing overnight battery draining issue, to give you an example i charged my phone at 78% yesterday at 7.40 PM and today morning at 97.00 AM the battery got drained upto 22%. I have not even touched my phone. I tried many things ,I was using low power mode, stopped background application refreshing, and even turned of wifi,mobile data and location. This was the costliest phone i bought last year and this has serious battery issues."
Positive,Do I need to write a review for iPhone ?People still gonna buy it anyway.Little bit disappointed from macro lens otherwise who criticize Apple.
Positive,"Best camera with cinematic mode, the wide-angle is good,  but the night vision contains noise. the battery backup is good."
Neutral,I thought the mobile would turn out to be very big.  It turned out to be small but the heart did not enjoy it.
Positive,Apple full value of money
Negetive,"If you are an Android user, stick to the best available Android in your budget. This is an over-hyped device which performs poorly on hygiene parameters (for eg. there is no function to go back), has poor precision in touch, limited battery life which dies much before the day ends to name a few. Also, transferring data from Android is an issue."
Positive,It's very beautiful and weight less so it's very easy to carry.So nice
Positive,I want to use this phone for my whole day work.
Positive,Packaging was very questionable but phone is great
Positive,Nice
Positive,Superb
Positive,"Moving from android to ios was not very easy however, now settling down slowly after initially facing lots of issue. Was expecting more from camera particularly in photo section and battery. Rest only time will tell If a U turn would be needed or not."
Positive,I switch to I Android from I phone.After 7 months use . I give a genuine review . It's all' over good performance.
Positive,Good
Positive,Save money and buy this phone. You will not regret later. Smooth experience.
Positive,Everything about this device is perfect!
Positive,This is very much first time I am using an Iphone and my experience is very good until now. UI is very seamless and lag free but yes sometimes i noticed app crashing or getting refresh in background. Camera quality is superb especially for videography. Night photos are ok but can still see grains while taking photo in low light situation.
Positive,Apple never disappoints with its brand value. I had a great experience using their product. Thanks to Amazon for the same-day delivery.
Negetive,The phone's video calling is very poor and noisy and call drops in between the conversation. The defect arises later after the return window is closed! Very bad experience ??
Positive,"I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in many ways. The product I received was genuine, and the camera is absolutely lovely, capturing moments with stunning clarity and vividness. Overall, the iPhone 13 delivers a significant upgrade over my previous Android device, and although I was initially skeptical about downgrading from a 120Hz display to 60Hz, the phone's performance feels far from clunky or sluggish.The camera system on the iPhone 13 is nothing short of impressive. It produces stunning images, offering a level of detail and color accuracy.In terms of performance, the iPhone 13 truly shines. Its powerful A15 Bionic chip ensures smooth multitasking, seamless app navigation, and impressive gaming experiences. The device feels snappy and responsive, effortlessly handling resource-intensive tasks. I appreciate the optimized performance that comes with the iPhone 13.Now, let's address the issue that left me somewhat disappointed—the packaging. Considering the price tag of 61,000 INR, one would expect more attention to be paid to the packaging. Unfortunately, the phone arrived in a flimsy packet, which had clearly been subjected to the challenges of long-distance transportation. The iPhone box itself was damaged, but luckily, the phone inside was unharmed. It's disheartening to see such carelessness from the seller Appario Retail when it comes to packaging such an expensive device. I hope this issue can be addressed by the seller to ensure a better customer experience in the future.Despite the packaging mishap, the iPhone 13 has proven to be a remarkable device. If you're looking to switch from Android or upgrade from an older iPhone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth considering."
Neutral,"Hello guys! I purchased this at best price , when it's delivered there is no issue found in this product. No scratches and no cracks fully new and genuine product given by Amazon!!! When I checked after getting delivery all things are working perfectly fine ?? but after a day I updated my iphone so after I found an camera issue ( camera is shaking [ Rear Camera ] so guys I tried to replace the product but Amazon tolds me I have to go first in iPhone main showroom for diagnosis! Amazon just told me to go apple shop and told him what is happening with the phone , and if they deny to repair the product then I have to ask for (Denial report) so I firstly go in iVenus (apple authorised service centre) but they give me a job sheet not denial report but they refused to repair as well! Then after I go in Mumbai (Apple BKC) for service apple BKC is main showroom of iphone where they are very professional and talk in very fluent English as well! So they took my product for the repair then they took around 19 days to repair or replace the parts of my iphone !!! They replaced (Camera) but they also replaced Battery I asked why they replaced Battery so they told me some scratches on battery because they need to replace the battery !!! So guys this is my experience I shared with you !!!! I hope this will help you!."
Neutral,I want to include my GST details to claim GST inputs.
Positive,Excellent
Positive,Battery quality is bad and hence didn’t last long even though using social media and no gaming at all
Positive,"Perfect product! Awesome battery backup amazing camera, a all day batter backup improved and brilliant"
Positive,Nice product
Positive,Loved the delivery bcz the product is always the best by Apple
Positive,Nice product
Positive,Good
Positive,Not value for money
Neutral,Don’t go for 6.1 in feels ver small .After buying iPhone 13 it fee  very small ans compared to android phone . You can get 6.6 or more bigger screen and no c type  charging port .It’s better to buy iPhone 14 Pro you get 6.7inch display and c type charging port and also videos are more stable in this.
Positive,Very good but slightly heating but not very much good worth for money
Positive,Using I phone 13 for past few days.My honest reviewPros:Battery back up is good and improved.you could get easily for a compete day with moderate usageScreen quality is good and comparable to Super AMOLED display.Cons:Screen refresh rate is very low may be @ 60 hz which will strain your eye while scrolling on the web pages and apps which is not good from the price point.Even basic android mobiles will give this and this is not at all acceptable for an iPhone which is major con.Charger is not given in the box and need to be purchased additionally which is also not good at this price point.At least Charger and branded ear pieces have to be given along with box pack.Apple has to improve in these areas.
Positive,"Good packaging and seal box delivery, red color looks amazing, but don't buy with exchange offers!!"
Positive,"Great product in 50,500 rsUsing it feels great , also social confident, andDreamIn today’s , world 1st dream of the people is to have an iphone!Soon will upgrade to 15 pro !"

Positive,"It’s my first time using an iPhone and I’m loving it, totally worth the money for me, got it for just 37k in the great Indian festival sale (7k reduced by exchange including the exchange bonus of 3500 and the credit card discount of 2250)"
Positive,This is my first try iPhone. I had this long time dream of possessing an iPhone atleast once in my lifetime. And it finally got fullfilled. Thanks a lot Amazon ??????
Positive,Good
Neutral,Heats up fastly and battery drops soon
Positive,It's a very good phone and got a good deal on Amazon. I personally picked the 13 over the 14 as there are hardly any differences between the two. The difference I felt is not worth paying 20-30% additional. Overall the 13 does everything well that is expected of an iPhone.
Positive,Good and very prompt delivery. It’s working fine
Positive,I'm happy with Amazon service.Original product delivered
Positive,Very nice
Positive,Really very smart
Positive,Satisfied
Positive,"iPhone 13 is best for all the features like its battery life is very good , display is ultra hd , this phone has very fast charging like in 1 hour it fully charge your phone , i have used this mobile since last year and this is best value for money mobile phone under this price . It is better then iphone 14"
Positive,"I’m not a phone fanatic but here is my simple and honest review.As someone who has only used windows and android phones I must say, iPhone is a good upgrade. I do, however, have some issues with the phone. If you are a hard core android user then you WILL face some issues. As in, the fact that iPhone does not have built in call recording feature. In the case of messages, you can reply from the drawer itself but does not have mark as read option. Truecaller absolutely does not work in this phone. I am a premium member on truecaller and it is of no use cause i still get bombarded with spam calls. Dual sim is one nano sim and the other e-sim, no dual tray for both your sim card. I am having issues with screencast/mirroring as well. In short, all the small little things that seems normal and one’s that you’re used to in an android is basically missing in an iPhone. Other than that the phone is great. Camera is great with a lot of features (which I’m still learning). Sound is great. No annoying nudges to keep updating apps. It’ll silently update in the background without the prompt message that it is being updated. Easy to use once you get the hang of it.Update:- i have been using this phone since March’23 so it’s been 2 months now and I have found that this phone is starting to lag a little. Not much, just a little but it is annoying (having spent so much money you’d expect more). Also, even with full network bars i sometimes struggle to get net connection. I have to rely on wifi most of the times and it has become a burden."
Positive,"Likes -1. A good display2. Great dual speaker sound quality3. It’s fast. I am using for more than a month and it never hanged.4. Updated to IOS 16 and unlike Android phones it is bug free or has very less bugs5. Long term software & security support (a very few Android phone manufacturers gives 5 years OS support with less bugs)6. Consistent camera. I would say the camera is not so hi fi but takes consistently good photos7. Apps are well optimized. Even google apps like YouTube, Maps, Gmail etc works better in IOS rather than their own proprietary OS8. Widgets in IOS 15 and 16. Android has widgets for decades now but IOS took the user experience to a whole new level.9. The new boxy design (introduced with iPhone 12) is cool and looks good.10. Network & call quality is good.11. Haptic feedback is awesome.Dislikes (Some dislikes are due to myself being an Android user for decades)1. The ugly notch. Though they made a dynamic island with iPhone 14 but lets accept the truth its still ugly compared to the hole punch2. Battery life & charging speed.3. Lack of customization. I can’t place the icons wherever i feel like on the screen.4. Lack of fingerprint scanner. Face id is good but fingerprint scanner is more practical, specially when you pay contactless5. Being an Android user I am used to with swipe from the right edge of the screen to go back. In iPhone this is not working & you need to reach out to actual back buttons of the app.6. Settings app is messy as all installed app would show up on the main page. I would say Android settings app is more sophisticated.7. Lastly the price should’ve been less. With all discounts & all it comes ~60k INR and its costly.Overall I am satisfied switching to iPhone 13 from Android (used OnePlus 6t for 3 years). Last time I switched to iPhone was with iPhone 5S and I couldn’t stay for 6 months and switched to Android again. But this time IOS is better in terms of consistency & user experience."
Negetive,"I have faced this issue many times , once someone call me , I mute it from side button , then again when I try to pick the call it doesn't work , touch stop working.End I press side button once call get disconnected ( I can not off the screen or re-on )I purchase it on 7th aug 2024"
Positive,Best Smartphone under 50k for real. A little heating problem during charging otherwise worth every penny
Negetive,When I received the phone it felt like the brand new..But when I saw the round spot around the camera lense on 2nd day after delivery. I think that amazon fools customer.
Negetive,Received different specification & defective charging cable..
Negetive,"Don't buy expensive products with Amazon and especially Apple products. Once you buy it, it's left to the mercy of apple and Amazon. Neither of them care."
Negetive,I expected better camera quality at such price. but its bad. Selfie is blurry.
Positive,"The iPhone stands out as a testament to the blend of sophisticated design and cutting-edge technology that Apple is renowned for. With each new iteration, the iPhone continues to push the boundaries of what we expect from a smartphone.Firstly, the design of the iPhone is both elegant and functional. The sleek, minimalist look is not just about aesthetics; it's a reflection of the advanced technology housed within. The build quality is exceptional, with a premium feel that you notice the moment you hold it."
Negetive,Front camera wasn’t working. Got a defective piece.
Positive,My phone screen got damaged by just applying little pressure. No dents or cracks. Full screen black green and blue. Took 27k just to replace screen by authorised service center.
Positive,"Its been a couple of weeks since i get the phone, everything is perfect but lately i got this issue with over heating, i do not play any games my phone usage is mild but still this heating won't stop. I am out of words because i paid so much for this and still got this issue. Is there anything we can do about this ? Suggestion accepted .Thankiu"
Neutral,Same as I phone 12 ??. Who so ever is reading this review I suggest go for I phone 12
Positive,The camera quality is very good and the proceser is actually surpriseing hai na ki nhi hai hai na tu baas
Positive,"I have seen that many Amazon users have been skeptical about purchasing iPhone from Darshita ezone or Darshita electronics. After I ordered the product red iPhone 13 from Darshita ezone, because of these negative reviews, even I got scared. However, I didn't cancel my order and decided to wait. Though Amazon delivered the order little late than I expected, I have received a genuine iPhone 13 product red. I checked the model number and IMEI number. All are perfect. Have been using the phone for almost 3 weeks now. Even updated to iOS 17. It's a gem. No issues. No problem. Heating is understandable during charging. But that's already expected. Thumbs up to both Amazon and Darshita ezone. And do I need to write about iPhone 13? It's awesome already."
Positive,I am moving from Android to ios for the first time. It is been a marvelous experience to use iPhone. I regret now for being an android user. First of all the speed what they have mentioned as lightening speed yes i have experienced the lightening speed. Anything u share in whatsapp or any app u open it opens up in a flash. When I put the phone on charging it sometimes over heat the phone but now i have identified the reason for it too. Do not use the phone When on charging leave it untouched so that it won't over heat. No sort of pauses aur hanging issues at all.
Positive,It was a good phone basically I thought that the phone will in damaged conditions or refurbished phone or some of the featured list will low and i was afraid of that but it was all ok and i am happie about that and i bought it in great indian sale

Positive,"I was a Android user after several years I'm buying iphone , Was very sceptical of online ordering I mean the costly items but to my surprise everything went so smooth and very happy with the order.

Positive,So beautiful so elegant just looking like a wow
Positive,"I am writing this review after 10 days of using this phone. Now i can relate why no one wants to leave iPhone after using it once. Similarly i never want to switch back to any android phone ever. Thank you amazon for a one day delivery. Reflexive touch, vivid display, amazing camera quality and much more."

But delivery went well and i got the iPhone.No lies the phone is so far good but there's a catch when i unboxed the package the iPhone box had some dirt on it not too much but it was there then inside the box there was the phone which had some of dust particles on it i don't know how but the phone was sealed packed!!Now talking about the phone it's nice and it's been just one day of having it.. Will write a full review after a longer usage then conclude my thoughts on it but ya phone looks and feel in Starlight color is very premium. From switching Android to IOS it's bit a different feel can't explain that but yaa it'll take time to adjust."
Positive,"The iPhone 13 is a solid upgrade, especially for those coming from older models. Its improvements in battery life, camera capabilities, and processing power make it a worthwhile consideration. However, if you already have an iPhone 12, the changes might not be significant enough to justify an immediate upgrade unless the new camera features or increased battery life are particularly important to you"
Positive,Phone looks good as expected and working is amazing.

Positive,Nice phone delivered
Neutral,Good phone in budget
Positive,"Go for it,??"
Positive,"First thing first, checked if the product was original or not. For that, check the following1. If the screen has “True Tone” option.2. Check the Serial Number for “M” letter, indicates its new unit.3. Check if IMEI number of the product is same as mentioned on the box.4. Battery Health should be 100%.Pros:1. Camera is one of the best I have used so far.2. Haptic feedback is very great. I noticed it instantly.3. Battery optimisation is very good. It’s been more than a month and I have never charged it more than 85%. Still I get a days battery easily.4. OS. I have used Android before this. And change in OS was good change as well.Cons:Charge speed is slow. I only charge it when the battery % is around 20%. And it takes 1 to 1.5 hr to charge.Comments:I don’t play any games or do any heavy usage tasks on phone. It’s just daily tasks like social media, YouTube, etc."
Positive,Camera quality is just awesome ??Battery life is also niceOnly problem you will face if you switch from Android is refresh rateAnd don't know but apple keyboard isn't made for chatting or typing in lo al language.

Positive,"Well, i just love my iphone. No complaints. Just took some time to adjust to this but now it's perfect."
Negetive,Received iPhone 13 with broken seal
Negetive,"Things to remember before you buy an Iphone -1) It is good only untill its warranty is there, for extended warranty, it is 10k approx for one year.2) Under warranty also, it's resell value is only 25k in Apple store, so this itself explains that the mobile is over-priced, and that's why resell value under warranty is 25k which is it's actual value.3) Once the warranty expires - Apple will keep on bringing in updated versions and the updated versions will mall function in a 1 year old Iphone as well. Problems include - Green screen, network issues, etc.4) Many people Iphones underwent Green Screen after the latest update and as their Iphone was not under warranty had to spend 400$ or 11k to 15k depending upon their model for screen repair or change. Meaning Apple company will release update, because of which the Iphone will malfunction and people have to spend money inorder to repair it.5) Iphone - covers, tampered glass are all very expensive and are of third class quality and design. Even after spending 1500 to 2000 INR for an Iphone cover, it will last only for 6-8 months. After that, either it will become dull, dirty or look ugly or pale. An android cover of 250 Rs also functions the same way.6) Apps - That is a total scam everyone knows that. You have to pay for many apps and many apps are still unavailable in App StoreMoral of the story -You can buy an expensive Iphone and use it comfortable for a year or maximum 2. So, if you are ready to spend so much money just for a year, it is the best mobile. For long run, this is just a scam that it will last for a long run.Joke of the year - You will be prompted with features that Iphone and Macbook's only have! - The only issue is, comman man never uses those features! So, people inorder to prove that this is a very unique feature, unnecessarily use it, show it and claim that it could be done only because they have an Iphone. Kudos to them for doing something alien!"
Positive,iPhone is good but they are double the cost for what they offerMaybe thrice
Positive,"9,/10"
Positive,Good product
Positive,Nyc phone
Negetive,It was excellent
Positive,Just can’t express my feeling.I am switching to ios from android and its super amazing. I was a bit worried at the time of delivery as I haven’t get the option for open box inspection. Rest all is fine . And about the phone there is no word which describes its . The most amazing and popular phone on the planet. Works really amaze
Positive,"Product is just wao...... But it took 15days to deliver and the packaging was very very poor, there was no plastic bag covered.. For packaging iam giving 1star only"
Positive,"Finally upgraded from my iPhone 7 to this, with my own money :))Super happy and grateful, still getting used to the larger screen.Everything works perfectly, games, battery life, software (now on iOS 16 public beta)But one thing I am super impressed by is the Wide Angle camera, maybe because this is my first time, but the results are insane!Something similar to fish-eye lenses!Will get some accessories as well, I already feel at home with the phone :))Thanks for reading!"
Positive,Good
Positive,Very nice ?????
Positive,Its My First iPhone and i was under assumption for it to be a big deal to have one.Not Upset with the purchase. Obviously proud to own one. Could have been Better.
Positive,"I am very pleased that I bought the original iphone 13.Just shifted from Android to iOS .. The new iphone 13 is a great phone with a lot of improvements. It has the best camera on the market..it works good in low light, the software is much improved, and the battery life is long lasting.Got this for - 66 K"
Negetive,"Now filpcart is offering open box delivery but Amazon just giving so called secure delivery.. the delivery person even not allowed me to see the package is tampered or ok at time of delivery… my friend also have the same experience with Amazon n delivery person. Although I got genuine product, but everybody concerned about right product delivery. Amazon is my first choice when it comes to online shopping, but Amazon should be taken care of that and have to introduce open box delivery.  ?????? moreover Amazon offers open box delivery for dishwasher, TVs etc.. where chances are very less to have product issues or missing.. lastly you will get open box delivery for a Tv of 32” purchased @ around 10k but not for a IPhone like products even costing from few thousand to around one n half lack???? still don’t go with Flipkart they are looting customers even after giving open box delivery… many fraud sellers are registered on Flipkart … so if having to much concern directly go to store n purchase there, even at store you can get card discounts n cash back like offers. In worst case you will pay 2 3k more as compared to online shopping but you will surely get original products… choice is yours….????"
Positive,Good working condition
Positive,"What a brilliant creation from apple , totally loved it."
Positive,For iPhone lover definitely should buy iPhone 13 rather than iPhone 14&15
Positive,"This device doesnt need any review as there are tons online , but as per my experience its all rounder champ. I bought 256 gb variant. All good till now.Just bit spectacular about the software updates if apple deliberately tries to downgrade the experience and camera quality.Camera quality:I felt iphone 14 gets better result not sure why? Although both device have same camera specs , is apple doing something fishy?Battery:Is decent ,usually lasts for a day."
Neutral,"Hi, I was android user for tha last 7 years. I decided to switch to IOS finally.First of all 128gb variant was out of stock, so had to buy the 256 gb variant. I have used it for few months, and i have mixed opinions. I will list the cons and pros:-Pros-1) Battery life is awesome. Easily goes a day without charging twice with good amount of social media usages.2) Really smooth UI experience. Feels like 90 fps.3) Display is top notch. Though the screen size could have been bigger.4)Charging is fast as compared to other 20W charging phones.5) Good face unlock feature.6) Great picture quality tho there are some problems i have discussed in cons.6) feels and looks premiumCons:-1) Not android friendly. If u are switching from android, u will find it very difficult to use.2) Sells by the name of privacy, but no privacy features like app lock, lock during calls is available.3) Few apps stop working very often. This maybe just with my device as i have doubts that i have recieved a defective device.4) Slo mo videos lags and skip frames on my device. Will get it check by service center.5)No c type support6) Notification management is very poor.7) lack of fingerprint scanner( only android users)8)file system is very bad . They say that it is so to secure the privacy. But it really sucks.So, if u can go with the cons listed above u can consider it to buy. I will recommend continue to stick to android. For less price you can get a better deal."
Positive,Everything is good except amazon delivery time... Almost 25 days required to get this product
Positive,Good without any issues.
Neutral,"Apple Marketing has done quite a good job month after month to keep people on their toes with their new launches where there is nothing great about this phone. I have been on Android for almost inception of phones and switching to iPhone is just a pain.1. No guide or help to transfer your critical data(Move to iOS doesnt work at all with high amount of data transfer.If you want to buy, go to brick and motor shop and get your data transfer then and there.2. Over hyped phone, nothing great i have found in the phone. May be i will find it better.3. Total stuck with ecosystem.4. At 90K they don't provide charger and are selling the same as extra. Total cheap strategy to earn more and promote their magsafe.I am not a happy customer till now! In a world where we talk about openness and open for integration, apple gives you a kind of black box... Boo to Apple!"
Positive,Good product
Neutral,I feel that my last ASUS android phone had a better battery life. An earlier iPad had a much much longer battery life.Rest is ok but the only issue that I am facing is with the battery.
Negetive,iPhone is not functioning properly no Internet is deducting from sim only wifi is working

Positive,Great Phone
Positive,"Good camera, nice performance, excellent display, fabulous sound"
Positive,Good product
Negetive,First of all they will deliver the mobilelateThey will then show the mobile exchange app the mobile is nt proper even when it's working fine.And have to pay remaining amount.They have sold the mobile..
Neutral,"Those who have been using Android phones may find iOS very limited in features. For example, you will have to pay for the premium plan of Truecaller if you want to monitor real-time calls for spam/block.The dialer app on iOS is a mess. It's tedious to find and locate a contact from within the dialer app.Using Gmail, Google Photos and other Google ecosystem apps that they have been using over years flawlessly is also no so smooth and flawless.Using iOS has come to me as a shocking experience of using my phone with excessive restrictions of the OS.Even the apps on Android OS are more flawless and smooth than on iOS.Last but not the least, if you're using Windows on your PC/laptop, an Android phone compliments more than what an Apple phone does. To this, you can see how seriously Microsoft is developing apps for Android.So, it was a productivity loss to switch from Android to iOS if you're a Windows user."
Positive,Product was good...but disappointed is that apple company provid the charger also in box.
Positive,It was a awesome experience to have a brand new pink iphone 13.I have got My new iphone today it was a amazing  experience. Though a little difficult to accept the changes of Android to iOS but as it is said changes are for good so very excited to share more feedbacks
Positive,Overall good
Negetive,Camera quality very bad like Android phone below Rs 4000 is this original product or duplicate product what to do or any option for camera setting I tried all settings option but not satisfied camera quality.

Positive,iPhone is best

Positive,Awesome experience after uses. It is totally value of money.
Positive,"We're pretty confident when we say that the iPhone 13 is the best iPhone for most people. It may look like Apple has only changed the position of one of the phone's back cameras since last year's model, but trust us when we say that there are more substantial upgrades than that. With a new display, larger battery, and better camera hardware and software, the iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones.Once again, Apple's made the iPhone 13 far more powerful than its Android competitors thanks to its 5G-ready A15 Bionic chip. If the raw performance doesn't interest you, photographers can play with the new Photographic Style filters in the camera app, while videographers will be excited by the new Cinematic mode focus-racking ability.The regular iPhone 13 has some flaws. The charging is still relatively slow compared to some Android phones. And I don't like that only the iPhone 13 Pro models get a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom. But based on my in-depth iPhone 13 review, this new iPhone is the best phone for the money.The overall display quality continues to be stellar. When watching the trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, I was mesmerized by the neon code encircling Neo as he walked down the street, and in another scene, I could make out individual hairs on Neo’s beard as he stared up into the sun.DISPLAY1. Smaller notch makes the display a bit more immersive2. Slightly different button placement3. Pink and blue are standout colors4. New Green color launched March 2022CAMERA1. Bright and colorful images beat Samsung2. Ultra-wide camera delivers more scenes and improved Night mode3. Photographic styles give you creative controlVIDEO1. Cinematic mode automatically changes focus on subjects while adding bokeh2. Superior Dolby Vision HDR video qualityPERFORMANCE and A15 Bionic1.A15 Bionic is the fastest chip once again2. Machine learning performance notably betterBATTERY LIFE1.10 hours and 33 minutes of battery life, which is 2 hours better than the iPhone 12Software1.SharePlay lets you watch videos and listen to music with friends2. Focus cuts down on distractionsVERDICT :The iPhone 13 improves on what was already the best iPhone for most people by introducing a bunch of welcome enhancements. I especially like the longer battery life, as the iPhone 12’s endurance was underwhelming even for a 5G phone. I wouldn’t recommend that iPhone 12 owners upgrade to the new iPhone, but the iPhone 13 is worth it if you own an iPhone 11 or older device.I don’t think many people will care about the smaller notch. What truly stands out on the iPhone 13 is the camera. The low-light performance is even better now, and computational photography features like Cinematic mode and Photographic styles flex the A15 Bionic’s muscles in ways that go way beyond benchmarks.I’m also glad Apple doubled the starting storage at 128GB, as that move was overdue and puts the new iPhone on par with Android flagships. I’d like to see Apple offering faster charging next time around — be it via USB-C or MagSafe — as well as a 120Hz display.The bottom line is that the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and raises the bar for what you think a camera phone can do."

Negetive,3rd class service from Amazon and Apple. Manufacturing defect products send to me.Worst experience of buying such premium phone. Front camera is faulty. They said no for replacement even it’s within 7 day replacement warranty. There is a black line comes when I click selfie. Don’t Purchase apple products from Amazon
Negetive,On right side it has h small dent
Positive,"Planning to buy it , I hope I get a better experience ,  hardly waiting  to buy but green colour want to experience charging quality appearance and features"
Positive,"’ve been using the iPhone 13 for the past 3-4 months, and I am thoroughly impressed with its overall performance. The A15 Bionic chip ensures smooth and lag-free operation, making multitasking a breeze.The camera quality is a standout feature, capturing vivid and detailed photos in various lighting conditions. The Night mode improvements are noticeable, delivering clear and sharp images even in low-light environments. The Cinematic mode for videos adds a professional touch, creating engaging and dynamic content."
Positive,"I had a 5 year old Redmi phone.I was unhappy as call recording stopped working, carrier video calling stopped working, battery charging speed reduced, fingerprint stopped working etc etc...So I bought an iPhone.Now I'm happy - it has no call recording (so cannot stop working), no carrier video calling (so cannot stop working), slow battery charging, no fingerprint (so cannot stop working) etc etc..."

Positive,very much satisfied with phone.... everything is working good. No wonder Apple is the best!!
Positive,Nice product
Positive,"you really don't need to upgrade if you bought a new iPhone last year. But anyone with an iPhone 11 or older will find enough new parts and features to consider the new modelsScreenThe screen is notably better than last year's. It's the first iPhone with Apple's ProMotion display, a very high refresh-rate screen technology that was introduced on the iPad Pro in 2017.The screen can adjust to the content on the page to help save battery life and make things feel smoother. If you're just reading a website, for example, it might refresh less frequently and save battery life. But then if you're gaming or scrolling through a long webpage, it'll refresh really fast to make everything much smoother.BatteryBattery life is top-notch and lasts longer than any other iPhone on the market. Unless you're playing games for hours and hoursThat's thanks to a combination of a newer processor, a new screen and a bigger battery. I streamed nine hours of movies, for example, with just over 50% brightness, and still had more than half the battery left.CameraThe regular wide-angle, the zoom and the ultra-wide-angle lenses on the back now allow in more light, which means they're better at taking pictures in the dark.The HDR feature is also better in situations where your subject might have a lot of light behind them, which can normally make people in a picture look dark — all the iPhone 13 phones can keep color and detail even if the sun is right behind someone.You can get really close to an object, like a blueberry or a flower, and capture a lot of detail."
Negetive,Waste of money not good in hand feel and canera is good in job but overall apple feel is not there
Positive,I do not have money that I can get a phone but I have a dream to get a phone which will definitely be fulfilled one day
Negetive,"Just but iphone 12!It’s not worth the money!Unless ur from BJP or something where you’re full with corrupt money, then go ahead."
Positive,Pretty Pink Color with amazing features apple has added to the new phone!Feels very light while holding the phone!Happy customer ??

Positive,Iphone at its best
Positive,"It's an absolute all rounder. I mean you know about apple right, it has never disappointed me this time neither"
Positive,Pranto chakdaha Nadia West Bengal
Positive,Has a good battery life. Charging is decently fast. Camera quality is unmatched. Excellent screen and display. Very easy and simple to use.
Positive,"The phone is awesome. The smoothness, the camera quality, display and the voice clarity are great. There is way better safety as every app asks to get tracked or not, to send you notifications or you can deny it. The phone in itself is so smooth and it’s so easy to edit videos or reels as no lagging is there.While the experience of switching from android to iOS was great, but there are so many things which are way more complicated in iOS.I can’t use true-caller and have to manually check the number, no headphone jack and airpods are kinda not useful for someone who talks for long hours on calls. (Planning to get the lightning cable wired apple earphones).Also, the fact that it does not have fingerprint is kinda shocking as phones starting from 10k also have that feature now, guess apple should really look in to it.Overall, I feel the pros outweigh the cons.Lastly, the BEST feature is the camera. The crystal clear quality of the camera was one of the reasons why I wanted to get the phone. My father has a Z fold, and personally I like the camera of the iPhone 13 way way better. Could be a personal preference, but I am satisfied."
Positive,Good One
Positive,I got this for 46k with all discounts it was good deal.. camera quality is awesome..
Positive,Nice
Positive,"I just love this model! Yes please would argue that it’s an old model but hear me out. The battery backup is substantially better than 14/15. The camera quality stands at power, the charging even tho not C type charges pretty quickly, the base and the speakers it’s pretty good. And even though the refresh rate is not that great, but it’s the exact same in 14/15.Not just that but there have been certain major issues with both those models that have put them on a really low selling models for Apple."
Positive,"It is how it should be,,,good."
Positive,Good
Positive,Awesome camera quality.not very user friendly in compared to android.This was the reason why it really took me 6yrs to shift finally 2 ios when it was finally worth.Best option got under 42k. First the exchange offer didn’t worked when it was 46 k incl all discounts and when they increased the price by rs 2k then only exchange option worked may b they fooled us for a price point under 40k but still I m happy with the price point I hv got. In market it is still 60 k. Hassle free exchange got 4450 for a damaged screen for oppo a5s . So all around I was really very happy plus 2250 SBI credit card discount.
Positive,"Reviewing after 4 months of usage. Like everyone else I always wanted to buy an Iphone. Tbh, camera is the best about it. I still use an Android for daily use and I don't think Iphone interface is user friendly for a long term Android user. But yes, Iphone is really awesome for the camera!"
Positive,Very good phone and camera is awesome but battery is very weak
Positive,Super I phone
Positive,"It is amazing me everyday , so many practical and professional features are there ,Awsome display , 20% brightness is enough for indoor activities,The smoothness of the UI is next level experience, the fluid like experience will make you praise it every now and then ,The feel in hand is very premium, feels true to its valueThe battery backup is phenomenal, for normal usage , it can cover upto 1-1.5 day easily on 100% charge , more than that maybe , depends on the casual usageThe camera is out of the world , the colour accuracy is on point, it completely true to natural, you will totally get the colour as I saw when I was taking it ,The skin tone is very accurate for selfies ,Compact size makes it slide into the palm of your hand.Sound quality is very natural, very loud , vocals are clear , very pleasing to earsOne word its awsome, I have bought it for 46000 during sale , every penny of it is truly valued"
Positive,At this price point it's one of the best phones you can get! iOS is smooth as always and the camera setup as absolutely clinical. The downside tho is the minimal battery life but it can get you through an entire day.
Positive,Value for money
Positive,"The first time I am purchasing a apple product, and I am really happy with the product, performance and the delivery."
Positive,"Its a great product. Few things I did not like is the size. I would prefer small sized phones. The option was deprecated when I bought.Also I liked the previous control center coming from bottom and not from top corner, while the phone is big"

Positive,Premium product

Positive,"Real, good and amazing product"
Positive,Performance-??????????Sound Quality-??????????All other ??????????
Positive,"Overall great value for money considering the long future run of usage when compared to Android(have been using One plus devices since 2017).Performance is good. If you are thinking within good price and in the aspect of long run, then I suggest you to go for this."
Negetive,Battery backup is pathetic ..Regretting buying it :( it's not even one month and I have two charge it twice and thrice :( return window is closed now else I would have returned it
Positive,Thinking of buying it for many years but avoided due to its high price… finally bought it and satisfied with the product.Mainly missing the normal headphone jack.
Positive,I was an android user. And I never thought that I would be able to switch to IOS but after I did I am liking it. It’s no different than android. Still there are few things where IOS is better.
Positive,"Battery life is good, camera quality is good, touch response is fabulous no lagging while playing games at all, I have switched from android to ios its good..!!"
Positive,I m satisfied with this beautiful product but I received F serious Serial number apart from signal issue  tower issue rest phone work good

Positive,Best phone for my life best camera ?? best gaming ?? mera phone 256Gb hei
Negetive,Received damaged piece which i was lately realised. Bought the mobile in October 2023. Observed screen flickering issue drastically from January 2024.

Positive,"Review after a month of usage.Decent battery and camera.Try using ios 15, it gives good battery backup."
Positive,Very good phone
Positive,"Awesome apple. 13 mini is handy. Easy to carry. Light weight. And very effective in daily usage. Battery is effective according to daily usage. Pictures, sound output, is always the best. Finally completed the 6 months emi. And finally the product is mine. ????"
Positive,The battery backup is good. The security features are great. I always receive notification with regards to security settings of the app and unlike in an android phone where many aspects of access rights are masked. The UI is brilliant and the speed of the phone is great
Positive,"If you are someone who is into good software experience than iphones are for you. If you can’t afford it then don’t buy it. Battery is improved, camera is good looks good and feels good thanks amazon"

Positive,Excellent
Negetive,Not at all worth the wait and price. I phone 11 and 12 were better version at this price points. Nothing much has been changed. Check before you buy and make a good decision.
Negetive,No biometrics with many UI flaws. Too expensive at 90K range.Better wait for new versions so that the price will drop for this version substantially.
Positive,Everything about this phone is best??GREAT BATTERY ??GREAT CAMERA ??GREAT DESIGN??
Positive,This phone has AMAZING FEATURES idk why people hate it this deserves to be liked more as the phone even has CINEMATIC MODE perfect for people who make movies

Positive,Liked the product for its design and color. Camera is better as well.
Positive,Awesome battery life as a iphone always lacks in and undoubtedly super camera.

Negetive,Bahar ka phone be h diya hame ab iska lock nahi open ho raha ????????
Positive,Decent battery life
Negetive,I dislike the product. The touch doesn't work properly. I wasted 77k on this.
Negetive,It is heating up when charging and being used 30 minutes.
Positive,No charger has been provided Nor booklet which I was expecting as a package. Rest is OkayTimely delivered with nice packing
Neutral,"I got the phone mainly for the camera. But it is very disappointing that even after paying top dollar you can’t get all the benefits of a good camera. iPhone can NOT take close up photos. It can’t zoom in on details. Also network and connectivity is poor. Whenever I’m traveling out of town the phone I’m unable to use mobile data. And even when in town, network is very poor. Apple and Jio aren’t the best even though they are assumed to be. Didn’t expect this from Apple.Cinematic mode is good. But it’s unable to focus on the subject properly a lot of times.Ear Speaker is malfunctioning right after just one year of use."
Positive,"Looks perfectly elegant. I bought the Red one @56499 only on Amazon republic day sale. At this price point, it's a great deal."
Positive,Mobile is good and comfortable best chargingAnd photos are best build coulity are bestBattery backup are good hande feel is good
Positive,"Long time android user here, I bought the iPhone 13 as a replacement of my android mid range and also to shoot Youtube videos as I think an iPhone offers better value than any 60-70k vlogging cam. Absolutely love the camera, battery backup, the build quality-just no words there. Unlike android, I do not have to worry for extended zoom and g calls--very reliable. Definitely, Apple got another long time iPhone customer."
Positive,Perfect phone with all the features and security guranteed. Price doesn't matter for such a boss. Working like butter ??
Positive,Nice product. Sturdy and best for security. Very less data visible or less ads. Nice product. Loved it. Recommended.. Afterall its iphone
Positive,Brand wise good phone. Though expensive but better for those who don't have much use and they are looking for safety quality and brand
Negetive,"I have made a mistake of going with the hype and buying the iPhone...It's a useless piece of trash for 50k. No functionality whatsoever. Just a piece of showoff,nothing else. I also have put up an ad olx.Rather go for samsung S series"
Negetive,"I purchased a refurbished iPhone 13, which is in very good condition. The screen is a dark and blurry aftermarket product that is far from the original. The battery is at 80%. I don't know what's so good about it. The quality is poor for this price. You might be better off buying it on Yahoo! Auctions or Mercari. I do not recommend purchasing it!"
Neutral,"I was able to purchase it cheaply, but the battery level of 85% was unexpectedly low. It's disappointing."
Neutral,It was better than I expected.
Negetive,"opened the iPhone, finished the initial setup, and did various things, but there was no charge, so even if I unplugged it, it didn't respond. Is it the one that doesn't charge but charges by putting it on? If so, it will respond. There must be dust stuck in the connector. Hmm, I got a bad luck."
Negetive,It was not initialized and I had to return it. It was a problem that went beyond the quality.
Negetive,"After the product arrived, the phone rang after the one-month return period had passed because I don't use the phone on a regular basis. I tried the voice memo function but it didn't record, so it's broken. Even though it's a used item, they didn't even check it?! It's terrible, even though I paid 110,000 yen. I'll never use it again."
Negetive,"understand that it is a refurbished product, but what does ""up to 93% battery"" mean? And the box says it is new. If possible, can I exchange it for one with at least 98% battery (I thought it should be 100% since it is supposed to be refurbished)?"
Neutral,"I liked the product, but when I opened the box I noticed a strange smell that resembled perfume. The instruction manual, the plastic that wrapped the phone, etc. all smelled like the kind of perfume that women use. It's a refurbished product, right?"
Positive,"It arrived without a box, just the main unit, a quick charger, and a set of pins. The exterior was brand new?! There were no scratches at all! I was able to change the model without any problems in operation. As everyone has written, I guess the only problem is the remaining battery power (^_^;) I can still use it normally, but I feel like I'll have to replace the battery soon."
Positive,"thought Type~C would be better, but I chose this one for the price. The color doesn't matter as long as you put the cover on, so I don't mind the appearance. I recommend it."
Positive,Battery capacity 91%
Positive,"I bought this as a gift for graduating from high school and getting accepted into college. I've been putting up with the iPhone 8 until now, so I'm very happy with it. The image quality and response speed are both good enough! On the other hand, I think any specs better than this would be too much."
Negetive,"Although it was said to be a certified product, there was a noticeable scratch (dent) and I was disappointed. I bought it for my wife, so I felt bad for her."
Positive,It was good
Positive,It was in very good condition. It has been two months since I purchased it and it is working without any problems. Thank you very much.
Neutral,"Although the appearance was in very good condition, the one I received was scratched, and the area around the switch and microphone was covered in sebum and dust. I was hoping for a nearly scratch-free, clean product, so I'm disappointed."
Neutral,The product I received had the color peeling off near the camera and dirt in the gap between the body and the screen. I think it was ranked as very good because it wasn't scratched. I think it's fine if you are aware of that.
Positive,begitulah
Positive,"Before purchasing, I was concerned about the remaining battery life and scratches, but I trusted the seller's rating of ""Very good"" and when I received the actual product, I was satisfied with the 86% remaining battery life for 13 models. The product is also in pretty good condition and I am really satisfied. However, the item I received was only the main unit and a set of charging products made by other companies, without the Apple box."
Positive,thank you
Negetive,"The product I received was full of scratches. Dents, 3 cracks, and to top it off, a scratch on the screen... What's ""very good"" about it?"
Positive,"The exterior was shiny, but the battery was worn out. I'm not sure if it was a hit or miss."
Positive,"- No noticeable scratches - Battery is at 82% - Operation is normal - 6-month warranty For the price, it is in good enough condition."
Positive,"The battery life that came with the phone was super low, so when I charged the phone it got reaaaallllyyyyy hot. I went to the Apple Store and get a new battery. But the rest is fine."
Positive,"Except some few scratches, it is a very good mobile phone"
Positive,"It was a beautiful item without any scratches, and although there was no outer box, it came with all the necessary accessories such as a SIM pin and a charging cord. However, the battery was at 87% (which is enough considering the price), so I gave it 4 stars. I am very satisfied."
Positive,"bought it for a relative, so I don't know for sure, but it seems to be in good condition and working fine. They were very happy with it."
Positive,"The device itself was in such good condition that it could be called new. It was carefully packaged, and a new third-party lightning cable and outlet were included. Before purchasing, I asked about the usability, performance, price, and AppleCare price of the 13 and 14 at the Apple Store, and decided on the refurbished product, which was 20,000 yen cheaper. Since I was upgrading from the 7, it was easy to place the two iPhones next to each other to transfer the data, and then do the necessary settings. I was also considering Android, but I think it was good to continue with the iPhone. There is also cheap smartphone insurance, so I plan to get it soon. I'm glad I bought the refurbished product."
Negetive,bought it in very good condition. It's a shame that the battery was at 83%.
Negetive,"Condition - Very good, so I had some expectations, but it was disappointing. There were two noticeable spots of paint peeling on the frame, and the battery was only at 82%. Since it was a refurbished item, I was prepared for some hits and misses, but it was very disappointing."
Neutral,"I received it the other day. However, it suddenly restarted while I was using it. I wanted to return or exchange it, but I didn't know how to do it, so I decided to write here."
Positive,"Before I bought it, I was worried about whether it would arrive properly and whether the battery capacity would be okay, but it arrived without any problems!! The battery capacity was 90, so I'm very satisfied ?? I bought it cheaply without any scratches, so I'd like to use it again! I'm really grateful ??"
Positive,"am very happy with it, it is almost like new."
Positive,"I bought the 13 because it was the best price. If you are used to Apple, you can use it without any problems. The battery is at 80%, so it's good. If you replace the battery, there is no problem."
Negetive,"I bought it because it was in very good condition, but the battery was only at 90% from the start and there were scratches on the side."
Neutral,"There were no noticeable scratches, and the phone itself was clean. However, the battery was exactly 80%, so the battery life was a little poor. The product description said that the battery was over 80%, but I never thought it would be that close. I had to replace the battery after a while, so I felt that I should have bought a different color for a few thousand yen more."
Positive,It's battery health is amazing 100%I love it it's affordable. Very satisfied with my decision to order from Amazon love it there is no scratches nothing everything is perfect and delivered safely.Thank You ????
Neutral,I bought the cheapest one with the same specifications and it was only 85% charged.
Positive,"I bought this for my son who is in high school. I read the reviews and was prepared for some scratches, but the item I received was in great condition without a single scratch. The battery performance was also at 91%, which was good. It might be okay to buy a second-hand one."
Positive,"The only things that bothered me were that there was no tool to remove the SIM card and that for some reason there was something that looked like an iPad instruction manual inside, but the battery is at 100% and I've been able to use it satisfactorily."
Neutral,"The battery capacity was 91%. It looks good. No sign of use. I bought it for 98,000 yen. To anyone considering buying it in the future. I'm not thinking of returning it. I do have some feelings of ""Hmm,"" but I trust the performance of the ""13"" battery and will use it for 5 years. I spent about 100,000 yen on it. I used the previous ""iPhone 8"" for about 3 and a half years. The transition from iPhone to iPhone isn't that exciting. That's why I think it's better to decide based on the color. Well, the color will be hidden by an iPhone case, though. Tee hee."
Positive,"For my child who is going to high school. I had been using a cheap Android phone until now, but I bought one because he wanted an iPhone when he went to high school. The battery capacity was 92% which was normal! I actually wanted the black one, but the seller of the black one had a 2-star rating when I looked, so I chose the blue one, and the seller had a 4-star rating, so I chose that one. There are no scratches and I am very satisfied with it even though it is used!"
Positive,Thank you. The seller is Gacha.
Positive,The battery is at 84%... sad but in good condition
Positive,"I bought a very good product, but there were some scratches on the frame that were over 1mm in size. However, I don't really care about those scratches, so it's not a problem. The LCD is clean, and the camera frame has scratches, but the glass is clean."
Neutral,The screen and lens frame were scratched and the battery was at 87%. I was looking at other reviews and wondering if there were hits and misses. What exactly was refurbished? I was expecting the outer layer and battery to have been replaced.
Neutral,"This was my first time using a refurbished product, and there was only a small scratch near the lens frame, but the rest was clean. It's just a frame, so it doesn't really bother me. The battery is at 84%, which is a bit of a strange feeling, but I knew that when I bought it, so it's nothing special."
Neutral,"I thought it was very good, so I thought it might have a bit more battery left... There were some scratches on the main unit, but I'm satisfied. I was able to change my phone model without any problems. It also came with a charger. I'll be using it from now on, so I'll give it 3 stars for now."
Positive,Rank: Very good value for money
Neutral,"would have liked it to be 90% or more, but it all comes down to luck."
Positive,"It's in such good condition that you wouldn't believe it's second-hand, and the battery is at 100% so I'm very happy with it."
Positive,"I was reluctant to buy it because of the gacha element, but I decided to go ahead and buy it. The battery was 85 and the appearance was almost unused. Since it was ""Very Good"", it also came with an external adapter and cable. It was not capable of fast charging, though. If you have received a bad ""Very Good"" product, I think you should check the conditions for ""Very Good"" once and if it does not meet the conditions, you can return it."
Negetive,Just 85% Dissapointed
Positive,"My previous phone wasn't very good so I was looking for a more advanced phone, so I'm glad I found this one."
Positive,"The main unit was clean and had no noticeable scratches. The battery was at 92%. I read other people's reviews and some had it at over 95%, so I was a little disappointed."
Positive,"The price was cheap, but since it was a refurbished product, the battery ran out quickly."
Negetive,Is this in very good condition? 84% full of scratches
Positive,"I was worried about buying a used one, so I chose this one. It's working fine."
Neutral,"I purchased a product in ""Very Good"" condition, but the maximum battery capacity was 86% when it arrived. Please note that unlike genuine Apple refurbished products, the battery may not have been replaced. Other than that, the condition was good."
Negetive,Dislike
Positive,"My SE2 started acting strangely, so I bought a new one. I was prepared for some trouble when I bought it because it was refurbished, but it was very clean and scratch-free, like new. I'm a little disappointed that the battery capacity was only 86%, but it's still worth it for 20,000 yen cheaper than a new one. Even when the battery was below 80% and I had to replace it, it was still cheaper than a new one. I'm glad I bought it because it looks like it will last a long time."
Positive,It was in like new condition!! The battery was at 100%! The midnight color is so pretty and cool.
Positive,"was a bit worried because other reviews seem to vary in quality, but this time it was a big hit. The battery was well over 90%, the device was intact, and it came with a charging cable, so it was as good as new. The setup went smoothly too. Thank you very much."
Positive,I like it because it's a beautiful solid state. The battery is...
Negetive,"I bought the ""Very Good"" version. There were no scratches on the body or camera, and the battery was at 91%, so I was very happy, but the camera was broken. I tried every possible solution, including updating and restarting, but the autofocus didn't work and I couldn't focus. It looked very nice and I was satisfied, so it was disappointing."
Positive,"iPhone 13, plain, green, 128GB. No outer box. But it was carefully packaged and I felt at ease. The device is in good condition with no scratches. I would like to use your service again if I have a next time."
Positive,"The package was not in the iPhone box, but was just bubble-wrapped. The color was what I ordered and the model was correct, but that was the only negative point."
Negetive,"I was happy to have such a nice smartphone, but after inserting the SIM, I couldn't make any calls. I had to contact the seller, Amazon, the product manufacturer, my mobile carrier, and then Amazon again, and after no improvement, I had to return the phone, which took me half a day. It was a good experience... but that's the risk of buying a used item..."
Positive,"It was a normal, beautiful smartphone. I was relieved to be able to use it without any problems."
Positive,The scratches were not noticeable and I was able to use it without any problems.
Positive,"It was a good purchase, just what I needed."
Positive,"The battery was at 85% capacity, which is about right. The exterior looked almost like new."
Neutral,"As expected, the packaging is a bit rough, or rather very simple. There is no excitement when opening an Apple product that Steve Jobs was particular about. It's recycled, so it can't be helped. (This is not taken into account in the score) The appearance is acceptable with no scratches, but it was a little dirty, so I'm giving it a minus 1. Even though it was refurbished, I think it's probably a problem with how the previous model was used, so this is probably an individual difference. Also, the battery is at 85%, and although it's not good to be greedy, there were other comments with over 90%, so I was a little hopeful, so I'm giving it a minus 1. I deliberately put a subjective evaluation here. Well, there's not much good news for the price, but it's not for people who have high expectations, but for people who can accept it as a no-brainer. This is not my first refurbished product, but I had a little too high expectations, so please take this as a reference."
Negetive,"There was a very noticeable scratch on the side. The description did not mention that. It did say that it had signs of use, but I thought that a scratch of that size should have been mentioned."
Positive,thank you very much.
Negetive,"The screen has many small scratches, and the back has many small stains that won't come off even if you wipe it hard. I don't mind scratches on the sides, but I wonder what the standard is for saying this is very good."
Negetive,"It arrived today. The packaging contained cushioning material, but there was not much, so the iPhone itself was moving around. The maximum capacity was 84%. Some people said it was 100%, but is that really true? The exterior was scratched and peeled, and there was some kind of dirt stuck to the side of the body, and it said it was refurbished - very good...I'm really not sure how they could have gotten such an evaluation. It was over 70,000 yen, so it's not a cheap purchase, so I'm very dissatisfied. I regret not buying it second-hand at a physical store."
Neutral,The smartphone I bought came with what appears to be a Softbank SIM card. What is this? I didn't get any signal from it though... Can I throw it away?
Positive,"I was a little worried because it was my first time buying a used item, but I was relieved to find that it was very clean and of good quality. I'm also happy that the price was within my budget."
Negetive,drew Baba
Negetive,"I received a piece of junk with only 86% battery left! I don't think you should buy it! I've bought a few so far, but most of the refurbished ones are junk! I recommend you avoid refurbished items on Amazon!"
Negetive,"There is a scratch on the back and the battery is at 86%. When I listened carefully, I noticed some distortion. I'm not satisfied. I'd like to return it and get a refund. Should I send an email to NikoSuma?"
Positive,"Arrived quickly. A few very light scratches around the sides, but otherwise almost perfect. Charged at 88%. Works great! Looks like it'll last another 2-3 years!"
Positive,"To be honest, I was nervous when I bought it, but it was like new and much cheaper than other companies, so I'm very satisfied with my purchase. Thank you ^ ^"
Negetive,"The appearance was very beautiful, but I was disappointed that the battery was only at 83%. There are no particular problems with operation."
Negetive,"Why is it only 86% charged even though I just bought it? It's a repaired item so I can't help it, but it should be at least 90% ?? That's weird"
Positive,There was no box and the charger was rubbish! There was no damage and the battery maxed out at 85%.
Positive,It was very beautiful and nice.
Negetive,"I bought it, but it was too expensive, the box was not the original iPhone, the screen did not have a sticker to protect it from scratches, and the charging cable was a different color! I was deceived."
Negetive,"As other reviews have said, the battery capacity of the one I received was 88%. Also, there are several scratches above and below the volume buttons. To be honest, you get what you pay for. I would have been better off buying a genuine new one, even if it was 20,000 to 30,000 yen more expensive. I understand that returns and exchanges are not possible, but I wonder if they could at least exchange it..."
Positive,Best product ever. Ordering from amazon from now on!
Negetive,"?The battery is already at 90% capacity?There are 3 small scratches (discoloration) on the side?No boxI bought this because it was about 12,000 yen cheaper than buying it from Apple, but considering the battery replacement, I thought it would have been better to buy a new one. If there are any other problems in the future, I may return it."
Positive,"It was a very high-quality item, but it was so clean that I couldn't believe it was second-hand, it was like new! It was well-maintained and I can use it without any problems. It was a great purchase!!"
Positive,"There were no scratches on the outside and it was in great condition! The battery was at 94% capacity, so I'm very satisfied."
Positive,Perfect
Positive,"I used to use Basio 4, but I decided to switch to iPhone. The operation is not so different, and it was surprisingly easy when I tried it."
Negetive,The battery was at 88% maximum capacity.
Positive,"It arrived the next day after I ordered it. The packaging was simple, but it worked without any problems. It also came with a new charging cable, although it was from a different company. It also came with a migration guide and a SIM removal pin, so I felt at ease and was able to migrate without any problems. Thank you!"
Negetive,"It said it was new on the cardboard box, but the maximum battery capacity was 87% on the day it arrived. Is it possible to exchange it? I was looking forward to it, so I'm shocked."
Positive,"The packaging was cheap, but the contents were a brand new iPhone. There were no scratches. The battery performance was about 97%, which is within the acceptable range. The new iPhone is expensive, so I think I'll stick with used iPhones from now on."
Positive,There is normally
Negetive,Bad battery
Negetive,"The battery runs out quickly and it is useless. However, it seems that the phone cannot be returned or exchanged. I threw away 80,000 yen."
Negetive,"I bought it at the beginning of December, and even when fully charged, the battery is less than 90%, and the warranty says it should be 100%, so I sent an inquiry, but there has been no response, and I don't know what to do. To be honest, I'm more sad than angry."
Positive,"Arrived from the seller Kosuma-san. This site deals with used and refurbished products with A to C ranks, but I think they are probably selling A. (At least the product that arrived.) The glass is undamaged, and the main body has some small scratches if you look closely, but I think it is in Amazon's ""very good condition"". However, so far it is as everyone expects, not better than expected. The battery, which I was concerned about, was 88%. It is advertised as 80% or more, but to be honest, 80% is in a broken state, so I think everyone would be dissatisfied if it really was 80% in ""very good condition"". So, what percentage is satisfactory? As other reviews have said, I think 90% is a psychological line. Just 90% is an average rating of 3 stars. Overall, including the condition of the main body, it is 4 stars. If it was 95%, everyone would give it 5 stars without complaint. However, the delivery was fast and the transaction was made without any problems, so I gave it 4 stars overall."
Positive,Battery level was 100%. Brand new.
Positive,As expected from Amazon. It looks like new and I'm very satisfied.
Negetive,"Don't be fooled by the word ""refurbished"". As you can see in the attached image, the battery is in terrible condition. It's only 86% full, so the battery life is very poor. It wouldn't be much more expensive to just buy a new one than to replace the battery in the main unit. I can't recommend this to anyone other than those who just want it to work."
Negetive,"I tried replacing the SIM card from my existing iPhone with this product (I tried about 10 times) but it didn't work at all. Please note that even if you replace it, you will not be able to use mobile data or make calls."
Negetive,"The exterior was in good condition with no noticeable scratches. There was no problem with the packaging. However, the battery capacity limit was lower than I expected. There was no original box, and the adapter and cable were third-party products that converted to micro-B. Of course, high-speed charging is not possible."
Negetive,"I bought two, and they were supposed to be SIM-free and refurbished by Amazon, but one of them was defective. When I contacted Amazon, they said it wasn't a product they made. I asked them if they hadn't refurbished it, but they said it wasn't a product they made. What is an Amazon refurbished product? I'm wondering."
Negetive,"I bought it as a ""very good"" item, but unfortunately there were two dents and scratches on the frame, and it had cigarette tar and a smell. The battery was at 84%."
Negetive,"bought it as a SIM-free product, but to my surprise it was SIM-locked. Furthermore, the serial number of the device did not seem to be a Japanese one, so when I contacted Apple Support, they told me that it was completely stuck and that I should return it."
Negetive,The iPhone 13 was SIM-free but it was SIM-locked. Is this a scam or something? I'm returning it.
Negetive,"I thought I bought something in ""very good"" condition, but even when I looked at it from 30cm away, I could see many scratches. I wonder what kind of inspection they did. There was also dust (dirt) in some places. Was it really serviced? (I looked later and found several similar low reviews.)"
Positive,"There were no particular issues with the appearance or operation. The outer box and accessories are also in good condition and look like new, so I'm very satisfied."
Negetive,"ordered Starlight but received Midnight. The barcode sticker says White, so I think they put the barcode sticker on the wrong one. I'm disappointed because it's something I'll use for a long time and it's expensive."
Positive,"Switching from iPhone SE to 13. As expected, I don't feel like buying iPhoneSE3 because I already have 3 phones with the same case. I like fingerprint authentication, so I didn't have a good chance to replace it. However, I got tired of using it for almost 4 years and decided to replace it. The latest 15 is out, but I didn't feel it was worth the price difference with the 13. In fact, when using the 13, the screen is just the right size, the battery lasts a decent amount, and I don't feel the inconvenience of fingerprint authentication, so I think it was good. Still, I think iPhones are too expensive. I don't know when the iPhoneSE4 will be released, so I think it was a wise decision."
Positive,"bought this for my child. I couldn't find the 13 anywhere, and I was worried about buying a phone online, but I was relieved when it arrived safely. It wasn't in a box, but it was well packed and I was surprised that it even came with a charger, which wasn't included. It was clean with no noticeable scratches, and the battery life is good, so I'm happy. It was a pretty expensive purchase, but both my child and I are very happy."
Negetive,"The problem with refurbished products is the appearance and especially the battery. In the first place, users consider replacing their battery when it is around 80%, so no one wants to buy one with the same 80% battery. The lifespan of an iPhone is considered to be between 80% (0) and 100% (20) (within the range of 20). If it arrives at 80%, it cannot be said to be refurbished. Even when buying or reselling used iPhones, except for new ones, they have a maximum charge of 70-80%. Therefore, the way to distinguish between bad and good dealers is mostly determined by the scratches on the exterior and the battery capacity. Incidentally, the usage time at 70% is around 4 hours 70% to 100% (?) time with maximum load 80% usage time is around 6 hours (maximum charging time generally recommended for replacing) 90% usage time is more than 9 hours 100% usage time is more than 11 hours [Those that do not last half a day are likely to cause stress] I was debating between the 13 and the 14, and I bought the 13, and it was the right decision. The price had come down quite a bit, so I thought there might be differences, but the performance was exactly the same. The only difference was whether the number of cores was one more or one less, and there was almost no difference in terms of operation. There are probably only darker and lighter color variations, but it doesn't seem like an upgrade. The operation is sluggish on both the 13 and 14, and it feels like scrolling (screen movement) doesn't slide. I had the XSmax before, and it was smooth when scrolling (screen movement), so it's a bit disappointing."
Negetive,"There were no noticeable scratches or stains on the phone itself, but the battery was at 86%. I was super disappointed."
Negetive,"80% battery is too low! What does ""very good"" mean? I don't want to give it even one star!!"
Positive,"It came with a SIM pin and a charger cable. I'm not sure if it's genuine. There's not a single scratch on it, and the battery is 100%. I'm very happy with it."
Negetive,"It was written that it was in very good condition, so I bought it without any doubts, but I was surprised when I received it. The screen was floating. It's not like you can push it back. It's definitely not usable. I'm glad I noticed it right away. I returned it immediately. I'm so glad I didn't accidentally turn it on. I can't believe they inspected it and sent it out. I didn't want to give it even one star, but I had no choice because I couldn't move forward without pressing it."
Positive,There were no scratches and it was very good. I am very satisfied.
Positive,"I was a bit worried when it arrived, but it was in very good condition and the battery was at 97%. I would like to use it again if I have the opportunity."
Positive,The item arrived in very good condition and I am very happy.
Positive,It's in very good condition and I really like it. I'll take good care of it.
Negetive,"The iPhone itself is in good condition, but the maximum capacity of the battery is only 94% of what it was when it was new. Is this normal for a refurbished product?"
Negetive,"It arrived today. The glass isn't broken, but there are many scratches. It was a purchase that I wasn't excited about, even though it cost over 100,000 yen. I guess this is what used items are like. I've decided that when I trade it in, I'll send it off in good condition. I recommend it to people who don't plan on using it for a long time. I'll definitely buy from Apple next time."
Negetive,I'm sad that my battery is only at 82%.
Positive,It was like new and the charging cable was brand new in its case too. I'm very happy.
Positive,It will take some time to get used to purchasing when switching from an Android smartphone.
Positive,"It was my first time purchasing a refurbished product. There were many stores selling it, and after much deliberation and reading through reviews, I researched and researched company information, and finally decided to make a purchase from your company. It was a beautiful iPhone, like new, with 95% battery, so I was very satisfied with my purchase! Thank you very much. I would like to buy from your company again the next time I need to replace my phone, and would recommend you to anyone who is considering purchasing one. Thank you very much!"
Positive,"upgraded from the SE 2nd generation and purchased the ""Very Good"" condition. There were no scratches to the naked eye (at a distance of about 15 cm), the screen was not yellowed, and it looked quite clean. The battery was exactly 90%, but the condition for a refurbished product is over 80%, so I think it's reasonable considering the price. It was on sale for 79,800 yen and there were points increased, so it felt like a good deal. It's been two weeks since I started using it, just like the old model, and there are no particular bugs. The camera works without any problems. I'm impressed with the night mode. I feel that the image quality, sound quality, and battery life are much better than the SE 2nd generation, and I'm satisfied. By the way, I'm using the accessories I already had and haven't used any of the ones that were included. Maybe I didn't need them."
Positive,Best value for money
Negetive,"It had a nice appearance. However, when I put the SIM in, the communication was unstable and I couldn't use it. I went to an Aeon Mobile store thinking that the SIM might be bad, but it was fine. When I contacted Apple, they said that the iPhone itself was defective. I can't return it, so I'm just sad that it's so expensive. I'm currently contacting them because I want them to at least exchange it. I'll write about what happened after that."
Positive,"I am very satisfied with the iPhone I received, with 92% battery and no scratches. I think I will be fine with buying second-hand products from now on. I plan to continue using your service in the future!"
Negetive,"Someone showed up with 86% battery life, but mine was 82%. I'd need to replace the battery right away (cry). The sticker on the cardboard box said it was in good condition... Please tell me what's good about it."
Negetive,The battery was surprisingly worn out. Is that normal?
Positive,"There were some scratches that were not shown in the pictures or details, but it still works fine and I am using it."
Neutral,"The battery status of the device was 83%. If it wasn't at least 90% or more, it wouldn't be called ""Refurbished - Excellent"" as stated in the product description. I will never buy a refurbished product again."
Positive,"It arrived in great condition! No malfunctions! However, it's not black, but maybe it's just because I didn't do enough research. I thought it was black, but it's more like navy blue. I'll get white next time."
Negetive,"The exterior is almost scratch-free, but there are some scratches on the edge of the lens and the Lightning connector. The battery is at 83% so I've lowered the rating. It's been refurbished so this is no good."
Positive,I'm happy with it and have no problems. The charge was 86%.
Positive,It was a very good product.
Negetive,"bought it here because it was not working properly, but I couldn't use the mobile communication. I had the shop check if the SIM was bad, but they said that the SIM was fine and the problem was with the phone itself. It's very disappointing because I bought something that wasn't cheap. What's more, I couldn't return it or get a refund... It's better not to buy a smartphone here."
Positive,"I was very worried because it was second-hand and I saw the low reviews, but it arrived in very good condition. I bought it thinking that as long as the screen was clean, it was fine, and I didn't mind a few scratches. But it was in better condition than I expected. The battery was at 90%. My previous iPhone was totally destroyed, so I needed it urgently, so it was more than enough. The packaging was also very careful. Also, it came with a power outlet charger, which I guess was a service. But it's possible that I got lucky with the gacha, so I buy it at my own risk."
Positive,"This was my first time purchasing a refurbished product, so I was a little worried, but the appearance was very beautiful. The battery was at 88%, which was higher than I expected, so I was satisfied with that. The shipment arrived one day early, which was also good. I would like to order from you again if I have the opportunity."
Negetive,There was dirt all around the phone
Positive,"Upon closer inspection, I found that it was almost brand new, it came with a charger and data cable, and the battery capacity was at 99%. I was a bit surprised."
Positive,"The battery was at 92%. There are some small scratches on the bottom side, but you can't see them if you cover it, and it's in good condition. I'm very happy with it. I love it."
Negetive,The condition of the product was so bad that I couldn't return it even though I wanted to.
Positive,"There were no scratches on the screen or the body, and it was in good condition. I was also satisfied with the battery capacity, which was 95%. I had read other people's reviews before purchasing, and I wonder if models of this color tend to have a relatively large battery life."
Positive,"I've always bought carriers, but this was the first time I've bought one from Amazon. I was a little worried because it was a refurbished product, but I was impressed that it was in like-new condition. (The box was a bit scratched, but the device itself was fine.) The battery was at 100% capacity (is this a good deal? Or is this normal?). It was the best purchase I've ever made on Amazon (according to my own research)."
Positive,"I was looking at the reviews and it seemed like a gadget, so I was wondering whether to buy a new one from the Apple Store or from Amazon, but since it's for my daughter who is in high school, I took a gamble and chose this one, which is cheaper than a new one. It arrived quickly, the battery was at 100%, it was in the iPhone box, the charging cord was unused, and it was in almost new condition, so I was right to buy this! My daughter is also very happy because she's upgrading from the X. It's more than enough for a high school student."
Negetive,"The packaging was carefully wrapped, but when I opened it, there were numerous small scratches on the screen. It seems that they were probably there during shipping. I was looking forward to it, so it was disappointing."
Negetive,"I bought a SIM-free iPhone from Ecosta. However, the usage restrictions on SoftBank were set to ? on IME, and it was a situation where usage restrictions could be imposed at any time. When I inquired, IME stated it on the product page. Since the SIM lock has been removed, there is no problem in selling it as a SIM-free, and they said they could not provide a warranty, so they turned me away."
Neutral,I ordered the phone with FaceTime but after using the phone i relies it did not come with face time that was very disappointing.
Positive,"I bought it for my husband as a gift for my husband just love it, he has XR before. Works best like any other iPhone only issue is there are no accessories just a wire only even a Screen protector was not included.overall great product."
Positive,I purchased this on 15th Mar 2024. I received it and it was sold by iStyle authorized apple seller. The unit I received was genuine TRA unit brand new sealed box. Thanks amazon and iStyle for delivering an excellent online shopping experience.
Positive,Liked very much
Positive,As per the expectation
Positive,THE PRODUCT IS VERY GOOD AND PERFECTBUT THE PACKAGING THE AMAZONE BOX IS LITTLE BIG AND PHONE IS MOVING AND JURKING WHEN THEY DELIVERY TIME.IT SHOULD PACKING PERFECTLY WITHOUT MOVING THE MOBILE.MAYB SOME DAMAGE INCASE.I DONT KNW IF ANY ISSUE FOR MY DEVICE AFTER FEW DAYS
Positive,Received in good packaging and condition. cant say any thing bad as this phone working perfectly as it should be.
Positive,Good product
Positive,Perfect buying I ever had
Positive,The phone was in perfect condition and suited me very well . The delivery was smooth . The phone was ideal for me
Positive,"Fast delivery, without any troubles.Good price for 1-year-old product. Most valuable colour with combination of protective case."
Positive,Good Product. delivered same day.thanks
Positive,Great product. Got it delivered well ahead of time. No complaints so far!
Neutral,Phone box still original seals and protection fitted but there was only 61 days left of Apple Care. Not impressed.
Negetive,I just received my order iphone 13 product res. But why the box is open??? The original seal is cut? Why?
Positive,Good product.
Positive,Good ????
Negetive,"I bought this phone yesterday, facing issues like its getting heat while speaking and battery is not long lasting as i experienced until now. camera quality is good as other iphones."
Negetive,Hi I received the item and found that the warranty is only for 8 months ! How is this possible ? It should be 12 month.... @amazon team FBA can you check with the Apple and get back ASAP?
Positive,not worth it though
Positive,Best.
Positive,"Its worth to buy, i lovd the pink color it cames onlh with charger wire without the plug yoj neex tk buy separatly. the price realy expensive"
Positive,"Stop giving bad reviews because of facetime or no sealed box.. this device has facetime but facetime is not allowed inside UAE by the government, therefore it doesn't work inside UAE and you can't find it in your iphone but outside of UAE in any other country it will work. You can confirm by going to iphone settings and then notifications, FaceTime is present there !!!And secondly the iphone 13 series devices OFFICIALY don't come with Sealed boxes. And it doesn't mean the devices are used!"
Positive,Loved the way the data was transferred from my old iPhone to new iPhone without having to do a Cloud back up - perfect to keep loyalty for iPhone users when upgrading
Neutral,they mention it has facetime and digital dual sim card support. but no facetime and dual sim and also expensive than other place like general shop or noon. i like amazon so i bought from amazon. can you explain...
Positive,Perfect
Positive,It does come with facetime but it depends if your country supports facetime. It is brand new and never been opened.
Positive,"Quick delivery and iPhone 13 is as good as I expected, it was really a great update in the processing speed and photography feature."
Positive,i switch from Iphone XS and 13 looks amazing the only issue is Facetime not available in UAE
Positive,The color blue looks very good.
Positive,Delivery and item all good
Negetive,"Advertised that it comes with iOS15. Instead it was already on iOS16.2. Don't force updates on your customers. We buy the hardware, we own the hardware, we should decide what we want to do with it, not Apple."
Positive,Very good
Positive,Lovely product to gift for Xmas and new year
Negetive,My product was not good the screen came black suddenly and I want any one to follow me because this is up normal the mobile new and no accident was made on it please i want any one to call me and follow me urgently
Negetive,I bought this item and it came as fully used and IB a very bad situation. I brought back to Turkey as a gift and they opened and saw the situation. I am so upset. Never ever buy from here. Ready to use photos.
Positive,Very satisfied product. To get FaceTime make region changes in general settings
Positive,Happy with the phone
Negetive,Product looks good and super fast delivery but no Facetime.Please dont write such things to dodge customers as your overall ratings get impacted. I dont use Facetime and thats why it is not bothering me.
Neutral,My phone is getting heated up .. couldn’t understand the reason behind
Positive,Just as described. FaceTime included.
Positive,As per specification
Positive,Nice
Positive,Nice color
Positive,"Rest assured the phone is very much real and the deal is good, very good. Its quite interesting that amazon requires you to provide a code to the delivery associate to take delivery of the product. Love the security measure here.In regards to the actual smartphone, this blue color way is very nice. Looks great in person and the battery life and screen is superb."
Positive,Package came little bit dirty and crumpled otherwise it’s a good one
Negetive,Products is fineBut iam giving this rivew because of delivery service i wanted to get this product within 24hrAnd i paid extra moneyBut still amazon delivery was late usualAnd they did not refund my extra delivery charge also ??
Positive,"I like the shape and  size, but it’s rather heavy and the blue tint is not what I expected."
Positive,Perfect packing & trusted - UAE version I received.
Positive,Original and sealed
Positive,It was very Good Experience
Positive,"I live in Egypt and got this with a friend coming from Dubai, the phone is really great has great battery life. It has FACETIME like as it's written in case anyone wants to buy it but is afraid of the reviews. Facetime is not available in UAE even if the iPhone has FaceTime. so if you live outside the UAE, just order it and open the iPhone in your country and you will find FaceTime right there"
Positive,Advertise as having face time but it did not.could have gone to Apple Store and bought it there if have known
Positive,Original and as described.However noon is having little cheaper price
Positive,There is no face time
Positive,As would all apple fones :)
Positive,Good
Negetive,The iPhone does not come with FaceTime as advertised and had a manufacturing defect (No Service)
Negetive,This phone doesn’t have FaceTime as advertised. Please do not buy if you need FaceTime.
Positive,Very good
Positive,Perfect
Negetive,Every call regardless of the network connection goes completely blank after coupe of minutes . It is very frustrating and the caller at the other side disconnects the call. When I use the same SIM on another android phone no issue at all
Negetive,"Just a few days after I bought it, the volume button broke, and sometimes crash.Plz connect me ASAP and give me one active reason"
Negetive,While I got the option for FaceTime but it doesn’t have it
Negetive,expected a charger which was not available
Positive,I want USA version
Positive,Its valuable
Positive,What’s you expect out of an IphoneHowever still Apple products are overpriced
Positive,Met the expectations and delivered even before the delivery date.
Positive,I was very caution at the time of purchase but its Original Ireland Phone with FaceTime.Facetime will start outside UAE.
Positive,Ok
Positive,Original product exactly as described with even faster delivery
Negetive,"Product ordered on 3rd march Wednesday with Amazon Prime, showed delivery was 4th march that's Thursday. (with selection as Office location, which means weekend Saturday & Sunday is holiday). But the delivery team does not call till Saturday Noon 12PM and says I'm in front of your office location.. How and why? ?. i inform him we are back to Office on Monday and he can deliver on Monday 7th march.. but delivery guys doesn't come calls him multiple times no pick up. then he comes on 8th march Tuesday with the package (said he was off on Monday) we collect the package and open the Main Polyethene package. And for our surprise the iPhone Box package was neatly cut using a blade in one side before we even open it. so this is all so fishy and can never trust to order something valuable on Amazon website. a market place provider is just a market place provider. and better to avoid all these online shops and visit physical Apple store room and by the product.. Amazon take require action against the vendor who is packaging or the vendor who is delivery or the employ.."
Positive,Good product. Thank you
Positive,Very good condition I’m very happy
Positive,Love it
Positive,"Sound quality is very good. Performance is good and transfer of data from my old iPhone happened very fast. Software update was completed immediately after starting the phone . Only problem is that the charging cable is different and it doesn’t fit into USB port, so one must have an adapter or order one along with the iPhone."
Positive,100% ok
Positive,"it’s the best smart phone ( based on personal preference ) available in the market , by all means it does justifies it’s hype.also got it at such a stealing price, thank you Amazon??"
Positive,Excellent phone
Neutral,Ph acha h but 60 hz k refresh rate bahut slow feel krata h camra quality thik h but real h to jaisa real face h vese pic aayegi baaki slow charging h to isme bhi tym lgta h baaki sab theek h itna mhnge ph m ye sab kamiya jarur khalengi
Positive,Everything is better than my iPhone 12 except cell reception which is way worse here
Positive,"If you don’t like using big sized phone , go for it. One day battery life for above average use. Camera is good. Video is excellent, call reception is excellent, screen is really smooth ( if u have never used 120hz). Gaming is smooth although I won’t recommend for long and heavy gaming as it would drain the battery. Charging is quick. If you use 20WT APPLE power adapter then you would notice heat while charging. Then goes back normal after getting charged above 70%. In hand feel of the phone is really good. Base model itself feels more premium like pro models. Type c is really a good addition as it creates more functionality. Screen is really bright and visible even under direct sunlight. This is by far the best upgrade of base model iPhone in years. GO FOR IT!"
Positive,"Phone is overall a beast specially in terms of battery and camera it has improved a lot, display is also brighter compared to the old ones, a little upgrade in processor too and dynamic island is an add on to it which looks cool and will give you feel of a pro.There is nothing much difference between 60 and 120 hrtz considering the price because 60 hrtz of an iphone is much smoother than a android one.Im using this device from few days and only problem im facing that this phone is heating specially when you are updating to new ios so dont worry it happens when you update to newer ios.im Using 20 watt charger and its performing very well to my phone with little warm feeling which is normal due to fast charging.Dont think too much about battery health because you have spend a lot for this tech so use it without anxiety to its highest capacity."
Positive,I was using iPhone 13 and switching to 15 was a good choice I guess! The phone have  better camera than 13 as the lens are bigger with more megapixels also the Dynamic Island makes it more fun and engaging and the gaming experience is pretty smooth and amazing as it’s having iPhone 14 Pro Max chipset.
Neutral,"Good-Battery is really goodPerformance is very goodAnd generally all okBad-Heating issue while charging. It heats up like anything, it will eventually affect battery health in long term. A big downside."
Positive,"I really love the quality of the snaps , every ry single snaps from I phone 15 is just waawii"
Positive,"Recommended for those who are obsessed with Apple products. I'm not. Bought it for my wife. She is happy, so am I."
Positive,I like it
Negetive,Heating issues even after 17.1.1 update
Positive,"I upgraded to the iPhone 15 this year from my 2020 SE and it's a massive upgrade.Lots of quality of life changes, cameras are amazing but if you're not trapped in the Apple Ecosystem, Pixel does some amazing AI.The best thing about any new iPhone is that you know it'll last for 3-4 years if you take care of it. I am very happy with my purchase which cost me 64K after exchange and card offers from Apple.Oh, and this ""yellow"" is more like an off-white and gold combination, which imo looks the best out of all colours."
Negetive,"It is made of titanium. Seems Good Right?,No.The Build quite is worst.I prefer you iPhone 14Or Samsung. You can also see the build quality of IPhone 15 on YouTube I am right ??."
Positive,Good price
Positive,This phone iphone 15 have not finger sensor
Positive,"1. Good display -• Peak brightness is good and good visibility even in broad day light.• Clarity of the picture is good.2. Excellent camera update -• Portrait mode pictures are great.• Resolution of the picture has improved and can see more details.3. Dynamic island -• As a first time experience, it is exiting to see a separated put notch hanging and videos playing around it. Gotta see its uses in long run.4. USB - C• Gives us option to use other android chargers when needed. Great relief for apple users. Don’t have to be extra careful while packing :-P5. Colour - i bought it for my wife and pink colour was perfect.Note: This review is considering my previous phone was iphone 12."
Positive,Like all other iPhones with few new features.
Positive,Ordered iphone today. Loved the Amazon service. The model number started with an M and battery capacity was at 100%. Loved the color
Neutral,Phone is good. But Charging cable became faulty in few days only. Hope it will be replaced
Positive,It's a good product
Positive,An IPhone 15 in hand that too assembled in India is like a dream come TRUE....??
Positive,As usual good apple product
Positive,Nice Buy
Positive,The temperature of the phone is getting higher after using it for mire than 15-20 mints. But the heat is not 'out of expectation' level. Good phone.
Positive,It was a pleasure to walk around. The camera is also good.
Positive,Good Camera
Positive,Performance is great. Battery is too good and no heating issues except while charging which is common. Very light weight than previous iPhones and sound quality is superb
Positive,Good quality n performance ?Feels very premium ??
Negetive,Battery Draining with in 2 hrs.For charging it consumes min of 1.5 hrs to reach 100%Also Amazon is worst platform to buy this phone.Very worst response
Positive,I like this camera and photos I am a photographer I know ki camera aur phone kaisa hona chahiye mughe to achcha lga
Positive,"I was coming from Switzerland because there is also its very hard to buy right now so I booked it on amazon for my daughter who just been 18 plus as she is having her first international travel to spain. She loved it...camera, processor everything is dynamic. Cheers"
Positive,CAMERA EXCELLENT.Charger should be included.
Positive,Fell to the peer pressure of my grown-up child.....
Positive,"Overall very good product, specially long lasting battery, image & video quality, display quality are very clear."
Positive,Like value for money
Positive,This was my first iPhone using experience.iPhone is better the android .Only draw back is it drain battery fast.
Positive,All over Average
Positive,camera quality
Positive,"Very good battery, very good camera, sound quality is also good. Overall performance is excellent."
Positive,Got a very good deal and the model and variant is very Good.Thank you Amazon

Negetive,Worst iphone I ever seen. I hate this phone . I hate this phone lot. I don’t buy this phone??
Positive,"DesignOne of the most noticeable changes to the iPhone 15 is its new design. The phone now has rounded edges, which makes it feel more comfortable in the hand. It also has a new camera bump that is less pronounced than the one on the iPhone 14. DisplayThe iPhone 15 has the same 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display as the iPhone 14. However, the new display is brighter and has better contrast. It also supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision.PerformanceThe iPhone 15 is powered by the new A16 Bionic chip, which is the fastest mobile chip on the market.

Positive,Product deliver safely and ok but invoice and warranty slip still I can’t b downloaded from Amazon app and plz tell from where I got that
Positive,"It was a gift for my 16th bday, what would you expect, it’s an iPhone ofc it’s the best in class and has the best capabilities. If you’re thinking of buying it then just go for it, it is the best!"
Positive,Not that good. Phone is handy and for me I doesn’t make sense as iPhone X and 15 looks similar and refresh rate too poor. They charged more but big theifs even their competitors are eager to fetch money from customers but not ready to give worth the money. Customers need to slowly have to reject these brands and btw last 14 years using Apple products but it is worst in the sense not much up gradation. iPhone 15 pro max even pathetic
Positive,Good
Positive,"It has all that you need, pro model features are not required by most use purposes"
Positive,I like
Positive,Good quality
Positive,beautiful!!!!
Positive,good
Positive,Delivery was satisfactorilyProduct was good and safe
Positive,iPhone is only Apple phone. No other wise phone comparative in market than iPhone.
Positive,Experiencing first time ?????? Everything is amazing
Positive,"I love everything like color, touch, back side quality, camera, ultra fast process, etc., and what not?As always Apple rocks"
Positive,Hi… I ordered new IPhone and received it yesterday… heating a lot ..while transferring files from old phone
Positive,Beautiful? pictures
Positive,Upgrading from iPhone 11 to 15. Good one full day battery from 85% to 30% for normal users without gaming.Use apple adapter for good battery life.Camera images were very natural..Good sound output.For first week usage you may feel heat.. Then no heating issues so far.
Negetive,"I am facing heating issue while taking photos or videos. Just more than a minute phone got heated. And amazon not providing doorstep technician to this product. They asking me to travel 45 km afar apple service center, to check the phone and get denying letter.Also i have called tollfree number of apple service, they informed i will not face such issue if i bought product from there site, instead of 3rd party. Moreover i have informed the customer service issue on the same day but they are saying no techincian available for this product....And this is not mentioned in the description as well."
Positive,Finally shifted from Android. It's a fact x feeling though kept my Android with me just in case needed something as slowly learning iOS .So far so good happy with the purchase. Now can flaunt I too have iphone :)
Positive,Amazing and Cute
Positive,Value for money..better quality
Positive,Excellent
Positive,Delivered on same day. Indian version. SBI promo did not work as mentioned. So opted for icici emi on amazon pay card. Nothing to say about iphone. There are plenty of reviews on that.
Positive,"At starting am hesitating to buy this much costly phone as I am android user and mostly I used android phones below 20k so am not able to take decision to buy or not but I purchased and now am very happy and not getting feeling like why I spend almost 80k for a phone because am enjoying ui interface and many iPhone functions and feel I didn’t purchase this brand for show off actually am big fan of Steve jobs and I like apple products so overall experience about this phone is awesome and am not getting any regret feeling camera is very good , battery backup also good ,user interface is awesome"
Positive,Heating issues
Positive,"Go for this without a doubt instead of the 14 pro or previous ones. The camera is really the better one than all the previous versions. If you’re willing to give up on Always On Display, High Refresh Rates (iOS is optimised and you won’t feel any difference if you’ve never used a phone with high refresh rates.) and a Macro Lens then this is the one. The feel in hand is also amazing, you wouldn’t know unless you’ve held one. Type c is also a game-changer than all the previous versions."
Positive,Wonderful product with good features. Worth to buy.
Negetive,poor quality through and through except camera. its display is worse than oneplus 7t pro with more reflections and poor refresh rate. apple stifles third party integration like huawei watch and thus cannot use find phone feature unless app is open and minimized.mail sync doesnt refresh. eg android will refresh notification when mail is deleted or read on other source. animation is like a blink giving poor interaction. auto word correction is so bad that i turned it off. always on feature is not there despite oled. oled wuality black itself is bad because of extreme reflection. there was one good paid app files that apple replaced with its own and disabled ftp. cannot share photo on bluetooth.  too many crappy deliberate limitations. i disnt check otg feature and i am sure it is restricted and not there on apple.overall i decided to go back to oneplus loosing about ?45k in short few months. data is more important for me than phone.i had migrated from apple to bb in 2015. then to android in 2017. going back feels like going to stone agefinally speaker quality is bad. really bad with out of sync lower ends sounding like cheap woofer setup.camera is ok but then i am comparing to 7t pro and when i really need quality then i anyway use my fujifilm that no iphone can compare tosuch a terrible waste of moneyps: wireless charging is a joke with temp reaching 40 degrees. even wired charging reaches 37. this in controlled temp of 27 degree room temp. oneolus 7t pro barely touches 35 despite much faster charging speed
Positive,Excellent phone
Positive,Like
Neutral,"some lagging issue, some issues for used to large phone user"
Positive,I had an Iphone 12 and I switched to iphone 15.Honesty I do not feel any difference and does feels like holding the same device.  Dimensions are a bit sleeker this time.  Major camera improvements and the island is actually useful untill noticed.  I had options to buy s24 or this. I need consistency in life. I love the purchase . I still has the top 5 cameras compared to smartphones.
Positive,Very good product and I like so nice product top product in India i love this product aaaa aaa aaa
Negetive,"First and last mistake in choosing a phone is IPhoneYou cannot even record calls, it may be ban in USA but it’s not in India. Now a days call record is very important. Other many features you have to buy applications. Mostly important tasks are payable which are free in Android"
Positive,Working well after one month of usage with no heating issuesDynamic Island makes the iPhone even easier to navigate between apps
Positive,The camera quality is superb.. Good to buy.. Budget friendly.. It is very smooth.. Charging is awesome.. Ease of use....
Positive,"Amazing camera quality obviously surpasses most of the iPhones , battery life also is pretty good , very compact and handy type of phone , performance wise  definitely fast and off the display is the best feature of it"
Negetive,Quality is bad as the phone is heating. The phone is heating and even service centre is not giving any solution. They asked us to format the phone and try. We did that also but the phone is till getting heated to extent that it can’t be used. The product is defection.
Negetive,The phone doesn’t charge and Amazon guys neither gives replacement nor do they help service centre assistance at home. Poor service by Amazon and sub seller who is selling
Positive,Love it ????
Negetive,Without use kiye hi phone heat hota rhta h Battery b kb ud jari kuch pta ni chl ra itna gnda experience rhe ga I phone ka to mein kbhi na leti.. am disappoint ????
Negetive,"Phone missing, sugar packet inside"
Neutral,"The phone heats a lot while using even for basic tasks like scrolling websites or social media. Battery drain is also evident. The battery life is similar to my 4 year old used iPhone 11. Which says a lot about the battery life. Hope apple fixes this, else will likely move to Samsung or Nothing next"
Negetive,Poor front cam quality
Negetive,Worst quality phone refresh rate is not goodfull heating while chargingThis model was not up to the mark better to choose other models like 13 and 14
Negetive,Hitting problem when I am using 15 mintes. No no safe while usingi
Positive,Nice phone.
Positive,Everything’s ok ..
Positive,Awesome phone with awesome features. Specifically in love with photo and video quality of camera.Battery back up is decent so far used. Let’s see how many years battery lasts with optimal performance.User interface is far better than previous models.Value for money.
Positive,"Go for it guys , after 3 months of usage still I feel it"
Neutral,"After using for two days, here's what I found out. First, Android is way better when it comes to selfies. I'm literally looking for Xiaomi 13 pro to drop and I'll just jump for it. Iphone 15 is good when it comes to back camera, which is just unparalleled, with it's spectacular details and original color retention. However, the selfie camera is much worse, it catches all the blemishes on your face and makes you look uglier. Sound quality is superb, without a doubt. Scrolling through the phone is a bit slow compared to other phones, because of the 60hz, but it's still bearable. Voice calling sound is good and clear. USB c is a good thing which at least allowed me to charge on a different charger because I didn't have Apple charger right away. The height of Iphone 15 and plus is funny because they have almost all the same thing just height is bigger for plus. Also, I paid 3k more on this platform because the next day the price dropped on Amazon. At the end of the day, iphone is good, but Android always wins, no matter what."
Negetive,"So what could have been a great phone has turned into an absolute mockery! My 4.5 year old iPhone 11 is still running well and was a great value for money in the sense that I used it for 4 years instead of 2 that I did my previous phones, it is still serving well, but this one DOES NOT GET AI FEATURES! I still can't digest this, that this is still the latest iphone you can buy in the market, it sells for more than flagship prices and comes with lesser features than competitors and Apple chose not to provide AI features with it making this absolutely unacceptable. Apparently Apple cheaped out on RAM in this and only provided 6 gb whereas AI requires minimum 8 gb of RAM and this is the reason even M1 laptops and tablets with weaker NPU than iPhone 15 get AI and this doesn't! It would have been acceptable if it was a budget/flagship killer costing 30K or below but at this price it is a travesty!Second is the battery! My iPhone 11 with 1150 cycles still has 82% battery health but this one, even with using 80% charge limit function after just 185 cycles is at 94% and lasts noticeably less than when it was new! Just shows Apple is killing this phone on purpose to sell future models and the once mighty Apple who made trouble free actually premium flagships has nothing to innovate and is resorting to cheap tactics to sell phones.Really disappointed!"
Positive,"There are pros and cons to this model, but i am satisfied."
Positive,"Dianamic island makes this phone special than Iphone 14. price is same as 14 but this island make us feel like pro.Battery life is also good, we can use mobile up to 48 hrs in single charge."
Positive,Working excellent
Negetive,I ordered my iPhone 15 from Amazon in the month of November 2023. It worked just fine for few months. After which I was suddenly facing problems with my apps. Specifically Swiggy was not being downloaded and it was saying that my phone is a jailbroken device. I am extremely disappointed with the service.
Negetive,I am trying to transfer data from android phone to iphone and following the instruction given but it is not complete and giving troubles.
Negetive,"facing Liquid detection popup whenever i charge, i brought this phone on Nov 4th, it was working fine for 2 weeks, later when i connect with charger i see popup that liquid is detected cannot charge your mobile, i waited for 12hrs and see the same error message, then i visited to Icare center 3 times still issue remains same. please support me how to claim this ?"
Negetive,"I am from Android(Samsung flagship phones)  background. Comparatively , Build quality is good, Camera are superb. Speed is good. Security is designed well.. So far things are working fine for me. But few simple feature are not available in IOs which is little frustrating."
Negetive,Not as advertised. Not satisfied
Negetive,Defective iPhone 15 delivered
Positive,"Good product, the camera quality is too good.Must buy phone of the century.Go for it you will love it"
Negetive,Paying a lots of money for apple 15 .while using apple 15 it’s gets heats up like a road side brand mobile . Also while on charging mobile getting heats up. It’s a big with apple 15 . Be aware prior to buy this . I already use this then I share my experience here . Don’t buy this
Neutral,Not worth it screen refresh rate is very low expected atleast 90hz on such an expensive deviceOverpriced at this price
Positive,"First of it looks very very prime quality and nicely fit in your hands. I am an android user still I don't face issue at the time of operating. In India you have to download required apps from app store free of cost. Apple store not available in India. You can use two sim , one physical micro sim and other esim. Conversion of physical micro sim to esim is very easy and happen in just two hours from your home. But after conversion sms service restricted for 24 hours as per guidelines if TRAI. No issue of connectivity if you have good network strength of your desired operator. Very crispy screen gives no strain on your eyes. Battery life is awesome , 1 one day for heavy user and 2 days for light user. Smooth performance of IOS system, no lags ,no glitches , not a single problem when you get to use. Sound is also very big but very crystal clear. Value is on high side,  so though it is very good in all aspects,  many people may find it very difficult to purchase ."
Positive,Running smoothly..no problem at all.Camera is good and battery life is also good manage one day charging..also charge with any type c charging.Worth it phone under this range.
Positive,After so many follow ups finally received a product. Product is good
Positive,"Just made the transition and here’s my POV on the first ~2 month of usePros- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.….. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience"
Positive,Apple iPhone quite costly but quite good interface and operations systemIf you have no issue with spending money this is product you can buy.

Negetive,Not working to friendly apps Truecaller/call recording/and sudirect app really waste of money
Negetive,Sound quality is very poor
Positive,"Value for money, performance-??"
Negetive,"eSIM not working, what I do now. Very disappointed."
Negetive,I am sorry to write this but it is required to know that iPhone does not allow the WhatsApp chat history to transfer into it from Android. It is a sad part.
Negetive,I want to give 0 start but had to give one start
Positive,Good product
Positive,happy with product
Positive,Am a iPhone fan so no complaints….
Positive,Excellent product. The main concern is while charging the mobile is going too hot. If you touch the mobile whole body is too heating.
Positive,Got it with a good offer on Amazon. I like the phone. Has a battery that lasts a day and photos are good.
Positive,When I preordered to Amazon I will not sure about how my product get to me in what condition but Amazon did great work and if you have a budget of 80k then you should go for iPhone I will recommend you to purchase it without a blink because You will not get this type of iPhone specification in other iPhone but tbh I will say 60hz hurts to me because in this price you will get 144hz type display but iPhone is lit and the camera quality this time in non pro model is excellent compare to the past year I phone and the chipset A16 bionic is ???? and I am not a gamer but I will say because I will play 2 or 3 games of BGMI in this phone and fps gyroscope handling and battery consumption is excellent and game not render in hot spot place also so if you think buy iPhone go for this
Positive,Awesome Product. Value for money.
Positive,Thank u amazone.
Neutral,There are some jitters and lags also have heating issue
Positive,Really loved the iPhone 15 :)
Positive,Genuine device delivered as expected and on time! This was a surprise gift to my brother and he surprisingly loved it.. ??
Positive,"It is a gift to my wife and initially like many others I was unsure whether it's wise to pay such a large amount and buy this online....But, it's excellent, very fast delivery, great packaging and very professional service..Thanks a lot Amazon!"
Positive,"Performance is Best, Battery Backup is good and 20watt fast charging supportUse apple 20 watt adapter for charging or apple mfi certified charger"
Negetive,"Exchange value of 2 year old iPhone 11 12000. Now what is the dangerous scheme of Apple? Am I an iPhone lover or just an iPhone user? Was going to buy iPhone 15 but after seeing its exchange value now I am switching to Google Pixel 7A, it is good."
Negetive,Heating and battery issues.its not up standard it’s not value for money. finger sensor may add…… Just 4 day feel very bad
Positive,"The display is impressively bright, despite the 60 Hz, which I thought might be a drawback coming from a 120 Hz Android device. Surprisingly, it feels the same. The battery life is solid, providing around 1.5 days for mild phone users. As a developer, with light usage for content consumption and social media, I get around 8 hours of screen on time with 25-30% battery left. It charges quickly to 50% and then trickle charges to 100%, adapting to usage patterns for faster charging. Initially, there were some battery drain and heating issues, but they resolved as the phone learned my usage patterns.Now, the camera is impressive, especially in low light conditions. Despite lacking a dedicated long exposure mode, the default night option, averaging around 3 seconds, captures details even in the dark. Compared to the iPhone 14 and S21FE, the camera quality is top-notch. The auto portrait detection is a standout feature. Believe me no one explain the real use of that auto portrait theoretically until you try it.In terms of network, the dual 5G standby supports Vi and JIO 5G (eSim). Inside my house, I get around 500 Mbps, and outside easily surpass 1 Gbps. Call quality is excellent, with two introduced modes in the mic option available in the control center.This is my personal opinion; I'll update if I find anything noteworthy."
Positive,"We are paying huge amount to buy iPhone but they are not coming up with innovative solutions control device heating, device heats up massively, sometimes I feels holding a nuclear plant in hand,"
Positive,"Light weight,But battery is better working in 13"
Positive,"I had an interesting experience with the new model. The corners are noticeably curvier compared to the previous version, making the device sleeker. Unfortunately, the phone slipped out of my pant pocket while I was in an auto, and I only noticed after returning home. I quickly grabbed my iPad, locked my device, and used the ‘Find My’ app to track down my phone. Thankfully, it ended up in the hands of someone who wasn’t very tech-savvy and couldn’t figure out how to turn it off using the key combination. This allowed me to successfully locate and retrieve my device. Overall, it was quite an adventure. Now I slapped a rubber case on it and it’s not going anywhere."
Positive,Overall it's okay except the heating issue. Device got automatically heated up after watching a video at high quality.I hope apple will fix it in upcoming updates.
Positive,Good quality of photos and videos. Quality  of voice calling is good battery backup is good for normal phone user time over all my first this is my first I phone
Positive,Awesome
Positive,This phone is 5/5 but when you backup your WhatsApp full backup doesn’t happen and due to which I lot some of my data
Positive,Best iPhone in this price
Positive,"Nice product, safely delivered"
Positive,It is literally just a phone with an Apple logo on it. My sister forced me to buy this otherwise I would have bought poco ??

Negetive,Not charging within 15 days of buying.
Neutral,"Competitively priced for iPhone but quality is average,nothing great."
Positive,You can found best apples in the forest of amazon only. Nice product.
Positive,This is my second apple order from Amazon. I've also directly ordered from Apple website and I can say that the product is genuine and exactly same as when I get from Apple website. Quick delivery and securely sealed. Kudos to Amazon for trustworthy delivery.
Neutral,As always apple products are over priced
Positive,Good
Positive,"4* because there’s always room for improvement. For a phone that pricey, I expected it'll dance and come into my lap for unboxing"
Positive,What to tell about apple product security reasons excellent
Positive,Authentic product and 5 star for secured delivery. The seller was genuine and trustworthy.
Positive,Overall good
Positive,All good but have little heating problem.
Negetive,"I had iphone 11, pretty decent phone and I was proud with that phone. The finishing of iPhone 11 was the best, super camera and nice display.This iPhone 15 is a huge letdown... Small phone, no white color available and camera, photo quality is below than average. Many issues are there... Phone heats up, many times phone volume gets down without any reason and you will miss important calls. Most funny issue is my phone frequently forgetting my face and you cant accept call. It freezes... You will see phone is ringing infront of you but, you can't accept that call...!!! I bought iPhone 15 @79999/- in the month of October and in January it is on sale, gone down to 65000/-... so huge fall in price in such short time...!!! Apple... clock is ticking... another Nokia...??"
Negetive,"Worst phone , the phone is hanging , and heating issues not worth to the amount , don’t buy it"

Positive,The phone itself feels extremely lighter than the previous series and feels les venerable to falls the camera improvement are beyond nice..
Positive,very happy to buy after moving android to iphone . Camera is goood and perfomance also good battery life is also good.
Positive,Woooooooow very bootyful camera phone with no use dandia island and bery very dangerous processor phone only for risthedaro ki gand jalane lai liye
Negetive,Heating issue.. 15 min video recording.. full heating mobile..  some laaging issues..  25K android mobile is much better than this phone..  only buildup purpose u can use this..
Negetive,"*Nothing to say about the iPhone. It’s the best that is available.*Lot to say about Amazon’s delivery and exchange. Unfortunately had the idea to buy this with exchange of iPhone XR (bought from Amazon itself, invoice existing). On first attempt, the deliver agent says code fro rabbit exchange not working let me re attempt the delivery tomorrow. That tomorrow became 2 days, after lot of phone calls with Amazon and emails to and fro on 2nd attempt The rabbit exchange app that Amazon is mandating for exchange passed all the test (including battery at 80% life). But in the summery showed ‘mri_battery genuine’ and ‘mri_camera genuine’ as failed and generated a code which the delivery agent couldn’t input in his mobile. Says exchange is rejected ( mind you no message to that effect was displayed in his app), promptly cancels order and goes away.And that is the end of me buying high value electronic goods from Amazon.Do a favour do not buy with exchange from Amazon! You would save yourselves a lot of hassle.And Congratulations Amazon india folks on completing the process to make Amazon the worst customer centric company. May you crash and burn."
Negetive,"Received a defective product from Amazon. There was a deep hairline crack in the screen while unboxing the brand new iPhone 15.Initially Amazon didn't take any action or resolution. After I reached out to Apple, got to know that there are no such policies that customer should only reachout to Apple after purchasing Apple products. Resellers like Amazon should be responsible for any kind of damages. Finally after highlighting this point with Amazon, I got my refund.Similar issue happend with the Samsung s24 which I recently purchased.Amazon selling completely defective products."
Positive,It’s good
Positive,Good product ??
Positive,Very Nice Phone
Positive,The quality is good it is durable charging is fast and long lasting
Negetive,"We have brought Apple i phone, in hope to get a good phone after spending heavy money it,s great disappointment that the phone is heating up heavily even for 02 minutes of use,the battery dried up automatically when idle with in one hour.Such defective piece apple and amazon are selling after taking high prices,great disappointment. Now after purchase we have to run to service center to repair brand new phone.. Misery of the situation."
Negetive,Battery backup is very low and getting heated in 15 minutes only this is a duplicate iphone .amazon is selling duplicate
Negetive,It is my personal review after using it for more than 6 monthBattery is not Upto mark you have to charge couple of times in a day even you are not playing any gamesRefresh rate is very slow camera quality also decreases after month of use but phone give u an awesome feeling
Positive,"Performance , sound quality , value for money , fast charging , touch is very good , battery is ????"
Negetive,"camera quality very poor, performance ?? ??"
Positive,This phone is good and quite seamless for multitasking and the camera quality and features is excellent.
Positive,"Moved from android, display is impressiveCamera quality is excellent with 48MPBattery life is around 1.5 days on medium usage, around 1 day on more usage.No heating issues in latest OS update 17.1/17.2.Overall enjoying the product"
Positive,"Finally switched to android after using Nokia 8 sirocco for almost 5 years when it gave up , switched to IOS , good phone. Worth buying."
Positive,I upgraded from my old iPhone 11 and it’s been a very smooth experience using this device.
Positive,Good and quality
Positive,There is heating issue still there which not going to resolve yet officially
Positive,Too good
Positive,As usual I am a fan of Apple. After 11 I upgraded to 15. Same day delivery I got on launch day. Very smooth vs 11.
Positive,Good deal
Positive,I am an apple user since 2017. Ever since I have not looked back. It is getting even better day by day. And iPhone 15 has a lot of features which I always wished the previous would have. For example it comes with a C-type charging wire. So I wont get dissapointed when I ask a non - apple user for their charger. Also the night mode camera is love. The battery lasts whole day. Overall I loved it.
Positive,Worth !Camera and Decent Battery
Neutral,The device has heating issues has not much to offer when compared to its predecessors.It's just ornamental upgrade
Positive,"Amazing, we were looking for green color it's  like share ka fal metha Amazing we loved it. Good in everything quality, battery and picture quality as well. This is first iphone of our family. It is really amazing. Quality of pictures and premium look best thing of this phone"

Positive,Ugjjg
Positive,Good
Negetive,Good
Positive,Very Best baseline iPhone ever. even if you have a iphone 14 it is still a upgrade. the new frosted glass and rounded edges make it premium feel. camera is just awesome. better than 14 pro camera. battery is just like iphone 14. type c is also a welcome with braided  data cabel. just blue colour looks a lot like white.
Positive,"Heating issue still persists even after updating it to 17.0.3, rest of things are meeting my expectations."
Positive,Got great deal
Positive,iPhone 15 is faster and better looking than iPhone 12 .
Neutral,Heats too much that too with normal use

Positive,Excellent performance where is my invoice and other formalities? Warranty is also not available .
Positive,"I am from Android background. Comparatively , Build quality is good, Camera are superb. Speed is good. Security is designed well..  So far things are working fine for me. Android phones are well cheap, I am still to see those extra edges for double price I payed. Hope, I will."
Positive,Product is worth and as expected delivered within one day. Good packing also
Positive,A1 product
Positive,Excellent product
Positive,"Heats up, Camera is good only at daylight. Night photos are pathetic and artificial no to buy"

Positive,"For fast working,andoid fone are slow."
Positive,Nice phone
Positive,I like it
Positive,"I've switched from iPhone 13 to 15 and this transition definitely feels worthwhile. Got this for 66,000 using my SBI credit card + ongoing offers on Amazon.The delivery was secure and the packaging was impenetrable. The device interface is user friendly and the camera......well it's iPhone so you already know."
Positive,"Everyone know about pros , let's only talk about consBattery : worst than I expect . Many says it is iOS 17 behind poor battery life . Hardly 3-4 he if you travelling and your network changes frequently .. worst than my android devices .Performance : no doubt in performance , it's the best in the industry ,Camera : undoubtably very good in camera dipartment but I hardly take photos ??iOS : verry smooth and many good things are missing . Call recording , call pick up haptic , smart dial and many more little but verry important feature ..Many youtuber says there is no such use of dynamic island but listen to me it is verry usefull and looking cool tooPrice : obviously it's not value for money but it's far better than 13 and 14 launch price which is same . Although this time iPhone 15 far better than 15 pro"
Positive,Great performance
Positive,Nice mobile. Performance is awesome but pricey.
Positive,"The iPhone 15 is a solid upgrade with improvements across the board. The design is sleek, the display is gorgeous, and the performance is top-notch. The camera takes stunning photos, and iOS 17 offers some exciting new features. While there are a few minor shortcomings, the overall experience is undeniably impressive."
Positive,"Amazing phone, great touch sensitivity"
Positive,everything is good but the seller did not keep his promise of Rs 5000 cash back
Negetive,The what's up is getting hanged and when I am trying to return after the replace window is closed the Amazon is not ready to accept it.Just I am late by 10 hours the window is closed
Negetive,"New I phone 14 256 charging ke time bahut heat hota hai, Network connectivity bahut hi kharab hai mere dusre Android phone me jaha full network rehta hai isme 1 point network rehta haiâ€¦ Wifi connectivity range is also very poorâ€¦.."
Negetive,all are ok but camera  it very poor quality batter to us buy samsung glaxi s22 ultra 100 x zoom
Negetive,"iPhone is already broken when it got here, also the product is not genuine. I paid â‚¹82,000/- and i got a first copy product."
Positive,Good performance
Positive,Quality is goodAnd what else need to say about apple. Everyone knows
Positive,Nice
Positive,"The phone is good ,has nice camera quality and the sound quality is good."
Positive,"Loved it ,new colour is really special"
Positive,The mobile is awesome but made fewer upgradations on itâ€™s previous segment.
Neutral,1) Display - 4/52) durability - 3/53) Battery -2/54) iphone11 > iphone6 > iPhone14As we are addicted to apple we are using iPhone else no reason to buy this mobile
Neutral,"Just one problem and itâ€™s big one .Keep charger always with you.(which Apple doesnâ€™t provide with phone )5G consumes battery a lot.Need to charge 3 times in a day for normal use.iPhone 11 had better battery back up than this.Utterly disappointed , donâ€™t see a significant upgrade from iPhone -11 for the price paid"
Negetive,"Getting overheat, while on call, also whike using hot-spot and charging the device."
Neutral,Not sure how to check authenticity of the product
Neutral,"As a phone, not great. Does not get signal where even 2000 rupee phone works. Camera is good, but phone should first work as phone"
Neutral,No fingerprint option
Negetive,"It's a brand new iPhone and when I connect it to usb cable which comes in the box for charging, it does not charge at all. At once, I tght phone has hardware issues as I also updated it to the latest software version. As I bought it yesterday only, when I tried to replace it on Amazon, it's giving apple service center info instead of replacement option. I finally ordered a magsafe cable along with Amazon basics cable to cross check if the fault lies in the original cable. Today I received both magsafe and Amazon basics cable and thankfully both worked properly. It's such a shame for a brand like Apple, they don't do a proper testing before packing a faulty cable. After all, we as a customer pay almost 75k for this expensive phone and least we expect that we get a working product. I will visit apple service center next weekend and hopefully they replace the original cable"
Negetive,"Iphone 14 is a complete waste of money. Move to IoS doesn't work to transfer chats from Android. Bhim UPI is not getting registered. The battery life sucks, in a half an hour video call, power goes down like flowing water. I hate this phone. I am gonna move back to android after this. its a complete waste of money."
Negetive,This does feel like an iphone at all. Low light or night time photos look extremely bad (my 12k realme phone clicks better night time photos). Sometimes phone gets heated without any reason or while watching videos abruptly.I will not buy apple product now. It is not worth spending so much money.
Neutral,Not worth for cost
Positive,"Genuine product, verified from Apple Site as well as from Apple Retailers. Very smooth touch screen. Excellent security features."
Positive,Good @ low end use
Positive,Needless to say the brand name itself says a lot
Positive,Good
Positive,"A perfect update if you're using iPhone 11 or earlier model. Absolutely fabulous performance as expected with A15 bionic chip. As promised, night camera has a big leap. All day battery life. Go for it!!!"
Positive,I love itExcellent product
Positive,I like iphone sound quality but camera is ok ok zoom level is low â€¦â€¦battery life also superb and after one time charge it will continue for 2 days and fast chargingâ€¦worth to buy it
Positive,loved it
Positive,"I love this phone, it has oblivious good build quality, premium look, battery not so exciting still but does the job."
Positive,Product feel & experience is good and excellent in use.
Neutral,Nice
Negetive,"I am extremely disappointed with the product received. My voice canâ€™t be heard by the call recipient when I am talking on speaker. I informed the same to the Amazon team, on which they told me to visit the service centre. I visited the service center, the problem was rectified temporarily but again it is recurring. I called Apple Support and after diagnostics they are again insisting me to visit a service center. Is it a joke of Rs 77000? I request Amazon not to sell defectives products during celebration activities. And I will never recommend anybody to buy iphones on amazon especially when offers and discounts are advertised. Now I have to run to different service centers and wait for the solution. Itâ€™s a brand new phone (received on 11th August, 2023) and this is the situation. I have exchanged my old phone and I donâ€™t have any handset as of now."
Negetive,"I purchased an iPhone 14 from Amazon on 05 May 2023. I got defected software issue on this phone after usage after 4 months, I think Amazon sells only defected iPhone rejected from iPhone company"
Negetive,Back camera video Quality issue.

Positive,Very good
Positive,Very happy with the phone and love the colour.
Positive,Very niceCamera quality is really goodHandy and easy to use
Positive,Itâ€™s a good phone but donâ€™t think that itâ€™s perfect. It has its own problems.
Positive,"Pros:  Good Looking (4/5): The Blue color variant adds to the aesthetic appeal, making the iPhone 14 an eye-catching device.  Better than iPhone 12 (4/5): The iPhone 14 exhibits improvements over the iPhone 12, contributing to an enhanced user experience.  Good Camera (4/5): The camera performance is commendable, capturing high-quality images and enhancing the overall photography experience.In summary, the Apple iPhone 14 in Blue is a solid choice, offering a sleek design, improved features compared to the iPhone 12, and a reliable camera for capturing memorable moments."
Positive,I gifted this to my wife she was really happy to see this phone and the blue colour is Amazing
Positive,"Everything is perfect. Doesnâ€™t matter if itâ€™s having 60Hz refresh rate. Very reliable battery, camera, iOS."
Positive,Upgraded after 3 years from XS to 14 and there is a huge improvement in the battery. Improvement in the camera and performance as well. I will suggest to go for 13 instead of 14 as there is not much difference.
Positive,New phone new feels..love how apple make their same phone look like a new model..This new blue color is just mind-blowing

Positive,Most advanced camera systems with built in quality phone. Display is amazing and the video recording with cinematic mode is outstanding
Neutral,"Overall a good phone but battery performance is not that much good, battery life and health drains much faster than we think."
Neutral,Not good from iPhone 13
Negetive,"Fake seller, I got a defective iphone and it was really the toughest thing to get it return, so never buy any expensive electronics online, i learnt a lesson so recommending everyone to follow the same"
Negetive,First time purchased with great expectations. But very disappointed. Kotta sisalo pata sara. Poor network connectivity. Bad touch response at edges. Getting heated while charging etcâ€¦ multiple issues. Better not a option for a mobile. Security: any phone with proprietary software will be secure than an open source.
Negetive,"I was really excited about buying iPhone 14 and I am really disappointed with the product that I received. There are multiple issues with the phone, the major concern is that the phone is getting heated up way too much when charged for the first time. The overheating was observed in the consequent charges too. The battery back up was not more than 7 hours, which is astonishing. There is a serious issue with the speaker too, every time Iâ€™m on a call thereâ€™s echoing.Really disappointed with the product. I would not buy an iPhone on Amazon again."
Negetive,"Iâ€™m not really convinced about 5G capabilities of iPhone 14. I see network drop, 5G connectivity issues most of the time, even 4G issues. Not really convinced paying the amount I paid for iPhone. No additional features compared to iPhone 13. If not for showing off iPhones are not recommended. I struggle with Dual sim features of the phone also sometimes thereâ€™s n/e drop on either of the sim."
Negetive,"Not working as I felt. Not finding much difference between iPhone 11 and iPhone 14. Apple A15 Bionic Seems not gr8, feeling slower ."
Negetive,Recently took I phone 14 itâ€™s not working now
Negetive,"I have bought this iphonr 14 for my wife and from 20th the phone is gining problem..the voice is not going otherside...facing difgiculties to connect to Amazon or Amazon cutmer care or apple service centre but not geeting the problem rwsolved..After spendinh 70k we are faving tbe real difficultu but how to resolve, i dont know"
Negetive,I recently purchased I phone 14 and I'm not happy with this product. If anyone wants to buy I phone 14 so thus I will sell it..
Negetive,"This heats up even if you browse Whats app.Had big expectations with apple but this is disappointing,Camera quality is badVideo quality is awesome6 to 7 hours of screen on timeOverall I feel this is not worth the price.Should have bought the android @ quarter of its price"
Negetive,Product is defected please arrange for return asap. This was a gift and after opening we realised the phone is not working screen is not functional
Negetive,"While charging I am getting the blurred time in the red colour. While returning Amazon is redirecting to apple, Now apple is telling try to check with Amazon"
Negetive,"I never expected such this worst experience with iphone 14 model, it is working very slow, most of the activities are getting delayed , I am very boring and irritating to use it."
Negetive,"Not able to take back up from Android to I phone,Useless if it is not able to take transfer"
Negetive,Got a defective piece & Amazon isn't returning it. Never Buy from Amazon.
Negetive,Not a good product
Negetive,Nokia 1100 was way better than this phone.
Negetive,issues with front camera
Negetive,"Amazon delivery agent could not fill the OTP, thus Amazon cancelled the product.  Their system is stupid and i wasted 5 days waiting for the phone."
Neutral,"So far , very slow to setup.Heating a lot during setup.Rest is as usual."
Neutral,"The new iPhone 14 sort of fits into this category of product. Just sort of, though, since Apple has redesigned the internals quite a bit to facilitate easier repairability, among other things. Plus, you do get new cameras and a few other new features, iPhone 14 is essentially the same as the iPhone 13."
Negetive,"Apple provided defective charging cable. After 5-6 attempts, it works and that too in middle it stops charging. Loose and defective cable from apple. Big names and defective products"
Negetive,"there are a lot of user friends features missing in iPhone when compared To android for example, the back button which is basic and lot of other features missing on iPhone. It makes us less productive. Canâ€™t even add a Music file as a ringtone cannot easily move, photos and videos to your laptop. Itâ€™s a pain in the wrong place using iPhone. I am switching back to android.it was a waste of time and money buying iPhone."
Negetive,Phone will be heating and charging slow
Negetive,"worst purchase in my life, i need to charge 3time a day. charging time mobile overheating, only Hundred phone number only showed in recent calls it also include WhatsApp call, worst calculator, camera over hyped before i used poco f1 that camera was so better than iphone, no call recoding.useless phone waste my money.please don't by diphone"
Negetive,I was unaware that I phone -14 donâ€™t have airphone and adeptor . While called customer care they were very rude and unimaginable. While ordering I did not get any alert that this items is not returnable. However this is one of the bad experience with Amazon first time . I strongly recommend do not buy phone etc just for the convenience .. it is bad
Negetive,"Please donâ€™t buy online. I bought and gifted to my cousin on his birthday and now when he started using, the performance is so bad. And canâ€™t return now"
Negetive,Used product
Negetive,Phone  use Kiya hoova pak Kar ke dete ho plz mat kro frod
Positive,Iphone always high level
Positive,Good fast service
Positive,Security features
Positive,Best
Positive,"The Apple iPhone 14 (128 GB) (Starlight) is the most recent addition to the iPhone series, and it comes with a slew of exciting features that are sure to please its users. The increased storage capacity, which now stands at 128 GB, is one of the most significant improvements over its predecessor, providing ample space for storing photos, videos, and other important data.The Starlight color option is also visually appealing, with its soft, silvery hue lending a sleek and elegant appearance to the phone. The 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display on the phone is a visual treat, providing vivid and clear images whether you're browsing social media, watching videos, or playing games.The iPhone 14's powerful A18 chip, which delivers fast and efficient performance, is another standout feature."
Positive,Likes:1. The mobile is simply superb after years of using android device I have switched to IPHONE to be precise the performance is butter smooth2. The cinematic camera is just awesome3. The look is simple and cool4. Face unlock is best among the mobiles.5. Multitasking is superb.Dislike:1. The first day itself the phone got hanged to home screen alert I have to hard reboot and fortunately there was solution to overcome. I was little bit worried on that when I saw that.2. Front camera is not so great as per Iphone brand and standard.3. Control center is not customizable and it's very limited to few apps.4. Clear all feature is not there for opened features as such android.Overall it's good phone. I have got it in a good deal along with the exchange offer.
Positive,"At first i was hesitant to buy this or the samsung s23, but this turned out to be a better one, as its performance in very good and the elegant and simplistic design of this is simply fantastic"
Positive,Dimag
Positive,recentely bought iphone 14 i was android user form past 15 years1 phone is awesome super but more expensive apple is not providing adaptor for charge this is the main drawback to the apple company if you are first time purchaser you need to beg adptor from others. this one thing i dont like from apple overall goog
Positive,Camera quality is awesome
Positive,Just Awesome. Loving it!
Positive,"Phone is awesome and rest all everyone knows apple features security and also camera quality. 5 star for performance,Look and feel ."
Positive,Get a Iphone Feel like A PRO!ðŸ˜ŽThe camera quality is insane ðŸ«¡The cinematic mode is incredible ðŸ˜‡ðŸŽðŸ“±
Positive,"As all apple products, I phone 14 has much more increased battery life , camera can take low light photos , and impressive A15 ultra bionic processor makes the gaming experience super smooth .A worth buy.!"
Positive,Nice but almost same Not Purchased Yet But Buying after some time I Am Feeling Good About this Apple Product
Positive,"Its Iphone Bro.....What else is there to say? If Your Budget Is Too Big, Go For It Without Any Worries...."
Neutral,Product is fine and working condition but it took 7 days to deliver...... very pathetic from amazon..... it is very hard to wait after buying such an expansive product though at the time of placing order it was shown 2 days delivery..... Coming to the product apple name itself is known for eligant and classy product . Phone is very fast smooth like butter ....amazing experience after switching from laggish Android to smoothish ios... Battery very powerful camera is awesome processor is super fast ...display is crisp clear all high end graphic games run smoothly and hassle free....
Negetive,Phone ki quality good h but itna jyada cost me bekar h.
Negetive,"I am not able to charge phone through wired charger after the tenth day of purchase, then I visited apple service centre they said the phone charger socket is defective and need to be replaced which may be chargeable. New phone with few day of usage charger is not working and replacement is chargeable. Experience of using a new phone is worst experience for me somehow I manage to charge my phone through wireless charger only"
Negetive,Do not get an iphone for now. Their software updates cause hardware issues like damaged display and camera. In my case the latest 17.5.1 update broke the flash and the so called apple senior advisers read scripts like a robot. The service centers do what they please and they wanted 32000 to fix my flash issue that happened due to their update. Also in service centreâ€™s terms and conditions they can cause cosmetic damage and they will mot be responsible for that. Itâ€™s mentioned in their repair terms and agreements.
Neutral,Slow
Neutral,The apple product is a dream for everyone but after spending thousands of rupees you still get a damaged box is not acceptable. Amazon needs to be careful about the product handling this can effect the products quality also. However phone is working smoothly
Neutral,"It is just a review from my side so that its good for you to know before buying rather than regretting later.Positives:* Showoff* Camera* Sound* Security (they say, bt that blocks so many accessibility options for me)* So many awesome features as all iphone users say (which probably I will use once in a lifetime)Negatives for me (You may like it):1. No shortcut to change between vibration and no vibration frequently.2. No end call button on the lock screen.3. Call list is nonsense. It shows phone, whatsap and all other calls in same list.4. Go to a specific contact in call history n you can see only history of one day. Total length of call history is 100. Most probably you will not be able to find call history of previous week for a specific contact.5. Need of Itunes to copy music from PC to phone.6. No file manager like android where we can see and access complete folder structure.7. No silent and vibrate mode notification on screen.8. Need to buy separate adapter n earphones after already spending double.9. Cannot remove torch icon in iphone14 from lock screen. You may end up switching it on unwillingly.10. BT and WiFi shortcuts will just disconnect them. To turn off you need to go to Settings screen and turn it off again.11. In so many places, either text or files, there is no Select All option. (I'm waiting for android users to get all pics received in whatsapp after a trip).12. Takes a lot of time to get detected by devices when hotspot is on.13. At some screen you get stuck and you will miss the back button.14. Copy some mp3 files to your iphone and you will never be able to find it with default music app.15. Every app will be either on lot of home screens or organised under some groups. You will never get a clean home screen with 2 or 3 most frequently used apps and all other apps in a swipe up menu like android.16. No fingerprint sensor.Adding to the list after using for 2 months:17. Cannot turn off camera shutter sound in general mode.18. No option to flag contact as spam/scam.19. If you connect wireless BT device, it won't show battery percentage of BT device.20. You get a notification while using phone and you miss to open it, then you will not see it until you remember yourself to open notification screen. Notification icons won't be pinned on top of the screen like Android.21. If you use 2 SIM and want to switch mobile data between SIMs, there is no shortcut than going to Settings screen. Also, cannot see current amount of data used or left.List goes on and on, try it yourself.. No iphone owner speaks about limitations. Some people like iphone for these and others hate it for these. If you can pay double and handle these adjustments with work arounds, go ahead. Once you unlock and give your phone to someone, or once you give access permissions to apps, even iphone is not most secure. Fr example, If you are driving and someone wants to use your phone for music/maps etc., then you have to give your password, because there is no fingerprint option and face recogniton feature will become dangerous option."
Negetive,"The Iphone that I have purchased has got a small  chip on the side of my iphone . This has kind of ruined the iphone experience for me... After paying 60k for a new phone, the least you do is to expect a phone with perfect conditions in all aspects â€¦ having said about this small physical blemish, the overall performance of the phone has been nothing short of phenomenal and spectacular .. iPhone truly is amazing and iconic"
Neutral,"Expectations was very high, but it failed to match those expectations ! My another hanset is One plus 7 pro which is 2019 year handset and competing very well with this. Camera is also having black tint in low light !!! Screen refresh rate is still 60Hz !Yes,..."
Positive,"The Apple iPhone 14 is overall a great phone for anyone who is looking for high speed, excellent camera quality, and a day-long of battery life. The squared-off sides are more comfortable to hold in your hand in my opinion. I purchased this one and so far my experience has been wonderful. Something I like about this phone is its fast speed along with the different options the camera gives you. I wouldn't say the iPhone 14 has a better camera than the 13, rather I think they are more similar and there wasn't a dramatic improvement. The battery life is something that I wish was a little longer. It last about an hour or two more than the average iPhone 13, but does charge faster. I have been able to receive about a 50% charge in 30 minutes. Another great feature of this phone is the painless eSIM setup. Being able to set up the SIM card virtually and not a physical transfer on your phone makes carrying over carriers from phone to phone much easier. battery lasts as long as the iPhone 13. As you may remember, it was much better than the iPhone 12. The iPhone 14 is a smooth, responsive phone and great for high-quality gaming or photo and video editing. Overall I think this is a great phone to purchase if you are looking for a durable and sustainable upgrade and I do think it is worth the extra hundred dollars from the 13."
Positive,Nice
Positive,I am using it from 18 January 2024 only in 2 and half months battery health is 99% showingðŸ˜£
Positive,Go with the flow. If you want to show off buy it. If you are an existing android customer never buy an apple product untill and unless u have security trust issues.
Positive,"I prefer to have some privacy in life, I think apple suite is bit more private than google. It respects user privacy if you are not using third party apps. My options were stock android without google (something like lineageOS) or iPhone. I tried lineageOS but there was always something breaking in my phone. It couldn't become my daily driver; I wish most of the things in android were open source like maps and some other proprietary google apps. In the current state, I was left with choosing iPhone. For long, I had debated with myself about buying iPhone or not, I was using OnePlus 7T for last 3.5 years. The phone stopped getting updates and had many bugs. The software changed a lot, I hated it. All these OEM betraying consumers made me switch to iPhone in the end. I can't trust any other brand to have the consistency like apple has. That's my take in the phone market. I wish there was a consistent bloat free android brand with a great camera."
Positive,"I have switched from Android to IPhone 14 (but i am not making my older phone an orphan, as i will still be using it!). But believe me.. Though iPhones are over premium smartphones, still, an iPhone is an iPhone. You can't resist using it.Phone is awesome, refresh rate is awesome and most important, camera... is Amazing..! One thing I really miss is fingerprint scanner. And the audio jack..(as i am not airpods friendly person). Silent slider is super!! E-sim is not new but still creative. I liked it.Coming to accessibility, for first few days or a couple of week, you will feel uncomfortable and inconvenience while finding few settings and applications as you are addicted to Android. Don't panic, be calm and use 'google' baba or youtube 'didi' to find ways to get particular settings yoh are searching for in iphone. There are ton's of video's on it. AND, don't be shy or ashamed of searching these things on google as no one is perfect or know everything beforehand."
Positive,First time iPhone user like me amazed by iPhone 14. Its battery to camera and security settings are amazing. Go for iPhone 14 than other model. Prize and features â€¦
Positive,"The color is really good first of all and the Performance is obviously more than enough for my usage, Camera quality and everything else is pretty good except the battery life because thatâ€™s alright and not the best as i have experienced better to be honest but it does provide battery life for a whole day till now and from what iâ€™ve heard it will maintain to do so till it reaches approximately 95% battery health. I personally feel like this model is really value for money in comparison to other models of iPhone 14 series since iPhones with higher storage are generally heavily overpriced."
Positive,"This is my first ever iPhone and before ordering I was very particular about it's colour and size. I wanted the midnight variant in the regular size. It looks so sleek in person. Yes it is glossy and a finger-print magnet but I'll have to bear with it coz I simply like black phones. It's working perfectly. Also, i would like to add, the packing of such an expensive device was not up to the mark. I have seen how well Apple packs the box and ships to its customers in videos of people from other countries. The Amazon seller just put it in a large plastic bag. Though the box was unharmed when it reached me, I could still notice a little dented corners on the box, which could have been avoided if they had packed the box in a bigger carton with foams."
Positive,As usual an iPhone as it has to be
Negetive,This is the worst product. Heat up every single time while charging. Battery lasts for jst 4 hrs. Waste of money
Positive,It was really nice just that it fell into a well while holding so I request them to create grip in the back
Positive,Nice phone
Positive,Awesome
Positive,Competitive rate
Positive,Awesome

Positive,Better than Expectations
Positive,Awesome product
Positive,Genuine product
Positive,"FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO SAY!! Stop blaming Apple for being expensive and low features then android. IT is A premium Luxury brand for high end customers who want best in class performance and technology with ULTRA Security available in market. If you have questions about price, DUDE GO BUY ANDROID , U DONT DESERVE IT THEN. Janpath Market AND Times Square NYC are different they aren't same."
Positive,"The iPhone 13 is a powerful and feature-packed smartphone. It boasts a stunning display, a fast and efficient processor, and impressive camera capabilities. With its sleek design, improved battery life, and 5G connectivity, it offers a top-notch user experience. Overall, the iPhone 13 is a worthy upgrade for those seeking advanced technology and seamless performance in a mobile device."

Positive,Amazing quality
Positive,Excellent
Positive,iPhone has always worth the money ! The moment you take this masterpiece in your hand you know that you have invested your money for good. If you have more budget go for 14 pro or plus. Only issue was with Delivery executive and Amazon customer care.
Positive,The phone looks sleek like any other iPhone . I hv been using iPhone since many years . Since I got it only yesterday I cannot comment on battery life etc
Positive,Nice

Positive,Best All Time IOS
Positive,"A little overpriced but worth the buy. Even tho there is not much difference in the the version 13 or 14, But it just feels different everytime. Totally recommended"

Negetive,Defective charging cable provided. Too bad to have such defective product from apple. Its a total waste of time. Need to go to apple service center and get new charging cable.
Negetive,"After one week of usageI don't feel good about this purchase.Really bad.I switched from Android (Samsung Eco System) to IOS.IOS fails to give features.Not user-friendly.Talking about qualityBoth companies are equally good.What we pay for is featuresI can get good camera, ips68 etc under 40kBut what samsung has Achieved and giving the customers is truly unbelievable.Sorry Apple."
Negetive,"From day 1 SIM card was not detected, I gave it off to service center for replacement but they denied saying phone is modified. Amazon is saying Apple will help and Apple is saying Amazon will help, but in reality no one is helping."
Negetive,"It is the most lagging phone and it's speed is very slow , the phone is looking good but when you use it ,it's seems to be very slower than a normal Android phone  , if you what to purchase iphone then choose iphone 14 pro it's A16 bionic chic is so fast and no one can  compare any phones with iphone 14 pro............it's awesome ðŸ˜Ž"
Positive,"Just Wow, amazing product"
Positive,"Itâ€™s trusts worthyGo for it as a first time buyer i was scared but amazon has nailed itAmazing delivery, the security was just the best. Thank you Amazon"

Positive,What good product
Positive,Iâ€™m android user for 15 years and after that i love ios so try a new experience
Positive,Amazon has given genuine product.. we canâ€™t trust any other then Amazon.Will recommend to purchase it from here only
Positive,iPhone 14 has been a good experience on the eyes apart from the other advantages that iPhone delivers as default.
Positive,No need any review of this product. Everybody knows it. Only I selected buyer Appario Retail based on my previous experience.Genene product received in good condition.
Positive,This is my 1st self earned iphone 14.Android fanboy switched to ios and this exeprience is so good and hope it will remain same for upcoming years.Overall experience with Amazon and Apple - 4.7/5

Positive,Features and robustness of the phone .
Positive,Received well & using it. Good to buy.
Positive,Very liked the phone
Negetive,"Strong and honest review. If your a Indian just thought of trying apple once even though it costly for you, i suggest not to go for it strongly.1. Heating: the phone will get more hotter while charging.2. Battery: battery health drops to 80% just after a year and they say to replace battery which costs 9k plus3. Everything is paid. Even if u feel like changing ringtone of your choice4.if u have no knowledge of apple for your goodness stay like that and enjoy android which is complete user friendly"
Negetive,"I brought this model 1.3 years back. Without any physical damage display got repair. Lines came in my phone. I contacted service center they charged 28,000 so I contacted Apple service center. No. 1 fraud customer care. Don't go with brand lose your money."
Neutral,Yes you heard it right after using 3 months noticed Color started peeling out and lots of such issues listed over apple community such a bogus brand and bogus phone
Negetive,"Bought iphone 14pro with airpods thinking that it has best features, disappointed... There are so many options missing compare to AndroidNo call record featuresU cant easily switch sim cardsPhysical sim only oneIf u miss ur screen code... U have to do Hercules task to reset it, may be it costs a lot and waste of timeCharger and cable very expensiveToo much weightSo many other disadvantagesThink 10 times before buying Iphone"
Negetive,this i phone was fast and looks good but needs improvement in camera quality and connectivity. Display quality is good
Negetive,Apple india service center's practices appear to lack transparency regarding the specific repairs conducted and the replacement parts used. Before handing over your device ask them to open in front of you and take pictures else they will say some screws are missing and this device has been opened earlier. Hence this will not cover u der warranty
Negetive,Purchased in 2023 now it has seen  colour fade slowly ...Service Centre and Apple Support teams does not take any responsibility for this manufacturing issues..Suggesting all not purchased this one
Negetive,I purchased new iPhone 14 from amazon and it heats up after some time when i use it without plugged in charging.
Neutral,The phone is good but battery and adapter they should start giving free after the EU lawsuit. Hope Apple ðŸŽ make customers Appy.
Neutral,I am disappointed for battery backup otherwise this is awesome phone but battery backup is not good camera quality brilliant
Negetive,Fake product
Negetive,"If at all there is a service issue, God bless all as apple has the worst service and it takes minimum of 30 days definitely and not sure weather you will receive the device. I personally faced an issue my phone has been lost in the transit during the process of service and I haven't received my phone yet after submitting the iphone 14 pro max at Aptronix even after a month. Please think and buy."
Negetive,Phone is hanging.. and not able to use
Negetive,After use of Three days it's display is flickering....
Negetive,Late delivery and damage box iPhone 14 box my reminder mail but not solution and service
Negetive,I got the damaged product
Negetive,"touch is very poor, not working properly"
Negetive,After pay 66499rs directive product box not acceptable
Negetive,"Scratches found on camera edges, paint peel kind. Amazon failed to accept replacement. Recommended to buy iPhones in stores rather than getting disappointed."
Negetive,No comment
Positive,"Itâ€™s a 6.1 inch phone very convenient to hold on and I switched from android to Apple , found it convenient except for the fact could not transfer WhatsApp chats to it via the move to iOS app. Some error occurred , apart from that all good"
Positive,"Product is good as always, but this time delivery also very satisfying."
Positive,Super cool
Positive,"Got it for good price , best exchange value for my iPhone 11, properly packed, genuine product, best experience purchasing thank you Amazon."
Positive,GoodðŸ‘
Positive,"Unlike 13 and 13pro, 14 and 14pro has different chipsets."
Positive,"Great display, great colour, lightweight. Very decent camera quality. Battery life is long. Have been using iPhone for the last 10 years. Would suggest one must go for it without hesitation."
Positive,I got it at a very great deal!! Amazing Camera and worth every penny!!
Positive,No need to write review. IPHONE always best. Iphone 14 is very handy.
Positive,This is new mobile. No one have used it before me. Fully packed box of mobile.
Positive,"Packaging from amazon not upto the mark. Flipkart does extra packaging to protect the product for rs 50-60 extra. This iphone was sent from amazon like a normal parcel, no bubble wrap even.If you like a bigger phone please buy iPhone 14plus. Iphone 14 regular one is small and handy 6.1 inches. Battery backup is amazing and also charging is fast. The last time i used iPhone was iphone 6 which had very bad battery backup and also slow charging.Also iphone 13 and 14 are not same.14 has more ram, better battery backup and 4k video recording which 13 does not have.So 14 would be a better buyAlso you will get one year more of updates.I got this phone in sale for 66k on march 2023. Can be more cheaper during September-october."
Positive,"Always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy.Overall good performanceðŸ”¥Great camera quality ðŸŒ†Fast A15 Bionic performance âš¡Impressive Action mode video ðŸŽ¥â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €â €"
Positive,good quality. decent battery.  good camera .of course over priced but u pay for the brand .quality performance .no hanging . smooth simple.interface
Positive,superb phone with good display and battery life. nice body
Positive,iPhone 14 I like. Initially I want to buy iPhone 14 plus. Price difference is 10k. But iPhone 14 is best. Even has smaller screen than iPhone 14 plus but itâ€™s ok. 6.1 inch screen is very fit in hands. iPhone 14 is best who are switching from android to iPhone.
Positive,"I upgraded from iPhone 11 to iPhone 14. In simple iPhone is best in all ways. Its costly but its worth it.Every feature of iPhone 14 is awesomeCamera, speed, flawness, etc are more than expected.Battery if you use more screen time then it will last for 7-8 hrs if not using much or simple use then it will easily last for more then one day.Go for it if you can afford instead of android."
Positive,"The blue colour looks amazing, very happy to purchase my 1st IphoneðŸ¥°"
Positive,All is good. Generally better than android. If youâ€™re thinking iPhone applications donâ€™t crash then youâ€™re wrong. They crash all the time in the background. Only phone is fast enough to load them back quickly. You will notice only if youâ€™rea heavy user. Screen is prone to scratches as itâ€™s softer than gorilla glass. Get a good tempered glass protector and a strong case to protect your most expensive purchase
Positive,Best
Positive,Camera is wow
Positive,Camera I like. Appearance also good. Value for money product
Positive,Best
Positive,Buying an iphone with my first salary is the dream i manifested it and it happened. Iâ€™m writing this review after 8 months. Camera quality everything is good. There is nothing to say about iphone the best always â¤ï¸. But what i observed is after IOS 17 battery started to drain like for 2 days one percent is dropping after that it stopped.Now my battery health is 93%. This is the only concern with iphone remaining all aspects it is worth the money.
Positive,Average phone
Positive,"I donâ€™t recommend to buy , iPhone because prices keeps on dropping buy this in sale only to get maximum benefit, I bought it for 70k now it is 53 k so lossâ€¦ðŸ¥¹"
Positive,Go for it
Positive,"Excellent product. Have been using Apple for 8 years now.Amazon Review-Donâ€™t buy from AmazonWanted to write down as I regretted every second of this purchasing experience. Pathetic delivery experience. Amazon took orders more that they could handle and the delivery associates cannot keep up. The system needs more transparency. If it was going to take time that could be mentioned and particular slot of 3-4 hours could be given instead of wasting 2 full days of my time. The whole system is either designed in a stupid way, or a fraudulent way, but not both.A product worth 70k was roaring on the streets and no one knew where. Customer support telling itâ€™s with delivery associate, delivery associates telling they have not been assigned this consignment. Customer support just keeping the calls on indefinite hold as they had no other answers."
Positive,Safely delivered
Positive,Excellent product
Negetive,"It is showing almost 24 - 33days to deliver it which is a lot of time , sadly I'm disappointed ðŸ˜”"
Negetive,Colour change mobile
Negetive,Like
Negetive,Truly disappointing
Negetive,Product was over heating worst one
Negetive,Not satisfied with the product ...Samsung Mid range phone is better in comparision of Camera..and operation...u will some time miss the fluency u find in the Anroid. Poor battery life..60Hz not worth it.Security is just a Hype thats all..one can steal and easily change ur password and can knock u out.i dnnt know y Iphone has so much craze until using it...i am using 14 but got bored within a week. S23 or s22ultra or one plus 11r is better in camera as it is giving telephoto lense and 120Hz in 50k range.I have literally wasted my money.
Neutral,"1 isme photo ko edit karna jaroori hai without filter photo are not good2 video in 60 fps 4k is awesome3 betary is ok not very good 6 hours continue with video youtube4 one plus 11, 10 is better option otherwise good in bbd sale 55k not bad deal"
Negetive,"I bought I phone 13pro max Sierra Blue for 1.39L in Dec 2021 from Croma Mount Road Chennai, last month ie after 19 months, camera failed to work literally, visited Apple service centre complained about it simply replied since the product doesn't cover warranty, I need to Pay 20k for replacement of the camera.  Honestly no physical damage..Complained to Apple customer support refused to extend any kind of service supportIf you really value your hard-earned money please think twice and thriceA product so-called premium phone, brought at 1.39l doesn't work for atleast 24 months..is it really worth it?Pls think of itI am attaching my phone seriel number and imei number for authenticity"
Negetive,The iPhone 14 pro max is considered the best phone. But it is hyped.. saying after use for a month. It is overrated for sure
Negetive,"I had bought a iphone 14 from amazon in  month of june 2023 month. Though  it started to develop serious faults afterwards.The major problem with the handset now is front & back camera that it does given clear picture  & even can't scan  QR code, we were unable to use it properly because the  camera did not work properly.We have done a lot complain with teleoperators about this phone from their trusting your services. Please provide us money back for the same."
Neutral,"If you wanna buy, then go for 14 pro or 13 pro max.  No use of buying latest version (14) with nothing new except camera."
Positive,"Looking for buying another, awesome product perfecto for gaming. Sound quality is perfect too. Waiting for the discount. Peace out"
Positive,"Genuine apple product, delivered as promised by Amazon. Itâ€™s total paisa vasool. Being an iPhone you can go for it with total peace of mind. Excellent camera both during day and night with a good battery life."
Positive,"It is genuine apple , I conformed it with the apple store in my city. I don't know about the other bad reviews here or on redit or quora regarding this sellers authenticity saying they don't give genuine products or whatever but mine was 100% genuine,  good camera , battery (chargeing) is OK  , totally value for money but  apple should start selling the complete charger again with iPhones that the only con I think is regarding value for money  , performance is excellent,  sound quality good , minor heating issue and so smooth touch function.  So totally satisfied by this purchase."
Positive,Evening think is good but price is not stable all time
Positive,Battery backup No good long time ðŸ¤”
Positive,"Using iphone 14 for over a week now, its just buttery smooth as expected the display is so amazing and the animations are done so precisely that you will actually forget that this has 60hz display. In term of camera quality back camera is really good, I donâ€™t like the selfie camera that much but i am not a selfie person so its fine with me. Battery is also good will give you upto 6-7hr backup"
Positive,I am completely happy with the product however the things which was unsatisfied is that it took more than a week to deliver even after paying in full before delivery and also the bill which was provided after opening was halfy printed as it appears to be half cutted may be printing error the main parts of billing information was not present I hope the next order will avoid any kind of error in future â€¦
Positive,"This review is for the people who want to shift from Android to Apple as I did .I used Xiaomi K20 pro as my last device .I have been an mi phone for last 10 years and was happy with the value for money offered from the mi and also the camera was top notch for the prices .Fast forward to 2023 , I brought apple 14  , I always wanted to buy iPhone but due to battery back up and high costs I kept postponing.And believe me iPhone is not a smart phone to be compared with any android phones , this is in league of its own , so no comparison of orange to apple for sure.Silky smooth ui, touch screen , camera , sound , display , battery back up : Simply superb.You may face little difficulties in shifting to iPhone but little patience is all you need and you will love it for sure"
Positive,unhappy because no cost emi still charging gst + interest which was useless decision to buy the phone from the Amazon.
Positive,Liked the colour most.
Positive,"Pros:1. Powerful A15 Bionic chip2. Beautiful OLED display3. Excellent camera quality4. Long-lasting battery life5. Secure Face ID authentication6. Up to 5 years of software updatesCons:1. Expensive2. No major design changes from the iPhone 133. No headphone jack4. No expandable storageOverall, the iPhone 14 is a great phone, but it's not a major upgrade over the iPhone 13. If you're looking for a new iPhone, the iPhone 14 is a good option, but you may want to consider waiting for the iPhone 15, which is expected to have more significant changes."
Neutral,"During the return, Agent refused to take as he is saying that the IEMI data is not matching. I asked the currier boy to show IEMI which I have filled and same he didnâ€™t show it to match. Also, no where in the order summary it is being recorded as return failed and extra amount taken from customer.It appears only lucrative offer in return is being given to attract the customer only."
Neutral,"I have been using android for a long time and this is my first iphone (not because i wanted to) but because of my professional needs.apart from trying to learn to ride a new pony i am bit disappointed esp with the screen size. although it says 6.1"" it is much smaller than my OnePlus 6T which is also 6.1"", which is just a perfect size for me. Had I known I would have gone for 14 plus which is advertised as 6.4""Apart from that the hardware is smooth and camera is decent.no fingerprint scanner but uses faceID"
Negetive,I brought iPhone 14 from Amazon. After 6 days mobile shutdown. didn't switching on. And I went to apple service center. they had denied to replaced my phone. they forced me to repair my mobile. after that i I had contacted Amazon. They had  refunded my money but it took 1 months credited money in my account.
Negetive,"I got defective product, it has two dents on screen which are very small and process to return/refund initiating is very difficult, i need to visit the apple care for testing the product they found defect and gave written email in which they denied that we don't have any collab with these third party seller."
Neutral,Okkok
Negetive,"Network not working and SIM also not detecting ( tried different SIMs) this is within a year, poor quality hardware used."
Negetive,"The phone charger port is different, we can not use c-type charger cable. Not able to transfer anything using bluetooth from android phone to iphone."
Negetive,There was no charger received with the iphone which was delivered today
Neutral,Product was not good. I got a defective phone
Negetive,"Faulty product received. It had calling issues, disturbances and cracking noises during calls that were so loud that other side was never able to hear calls."
Negetive,Data cable defected.
Negetive,I buy iPhone 14 10 days back while Iâ€™m using phone very heat
Negetive,"I bought apple 14 year ago. Within one year my phone screen got green line, got repaired under warranty.But, after this repair water resistance property got damaged and it met with water. Liquid damaged. Now phone is not working properly..I have used 6s for almost 5 years, but they are compromising on quality. I couldnâ€™t find that quality no more with apple. So looking for android."
Negetive,Autofocus is not working for close objects very worst feature !! Don't go for it!!

Positive,"After using XR , this one is best"
Positive,I bought this in july 16 and now my cable is not working
Positive,Awesome phone ðŸ˜ŠâœŒðŸ»
Positive,Bought it as a gift for my sister. First iphone and now I understand why Apple is a 3 trillion company. There's just something about these products other companies fail to provide.From the smoothness of the ui to the touch and camera. It's really amazing!
Positive,I appreciate them for using bubble wrap but still a corner of the iPhone box was chipped (Probability during shipping). But still Amazon managed to deliver it without any hassle.
Positive,"All the features are out performing just good for it, it may seem the 13 and 14 are same itâ€™s not, thereâ€™s a big difference in camera especially in video thereâ€™s a big difference in video stability the OIS works excellent in iPhone 14 if your main focus is on videos then you should go for this apart from batter has a good improvement."
Positive,I got this phone for around 65000 rupees on the prime days sale on amazon. I am extremely impressed and satisfied. The phone is very sleek and fast. I previously had an iphone SE (2020) and am very satisfied with the upgrade. I also traded in the iphone SE and got a very good rate. I would highly recommend
Positive,"This phone is a gem. Photo clarity is awesome. This is the phone to use for ages given now iPhone has moved to type c port, this is the last generation of lightning charger."
Positive,"Migrating to iPhone for the first time, found out that Amazon offers it the cheapest with all its card offers. The base model is actually cheaper than the US. Delivery and packaging was very good.Phone performance- On an average getting 1.5 days of battery with moderate usage. Still getting used to the environment change, but its going well so far."
Positive,The best thing about this phone is its long battery. With normal use it can go beyond 48 hrs.
Positive,Better than One Plus
Positive,Few bugs like Siri not working sometimes.Getting hanged sometimes

Positive,iPhone 14 and iPhone 13 is a both are same. If you want to go for iPhone 13 you can go iPhone 14 and iPhone 13. There is not too much difference between them but okay
Positive,The product received was good with scratches or damages. The delivery boy was very kind and good person. It was his new job and only one week since he joined. I also congratulated him. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
Positive,"Everything is superb but , no one has Tell about the lens flair , only that is the Cone of all the iPhones , not only in this , this is the main issue in all .But the camera quality is superb you will not be disappointed ."
Positive,Packing was good . Itâ€™s an iPhone so works well .
Positive,Delivery experience was very good and i received genuine product.Phone review:The phone is nothing extra ordinary. The features of the phone are as par compared to basic mid-range budget phones from andriod.As far as camera goes the dynamic range of is it very good without any much color correction.Rest every thing is just average.You should go for this only if your an apple user fan or you always wanted an iphone.
Positive,Good
Positive,Very good product
Positive,"Using it as a daily driver.Have been an android users for the past 7 yrs, wanted to try something different in terms of OS. Had used windows also,This thing has grown upon me. Itâ€™s been just 20 days of the purchase and now I donâ€™t feel switching back to android.The best part is the battery life. I can see a noticeable difference between Android and iPhone . Also daily app usage experience is great as of now.Not a fan of any particular product. I you love android , then go for android or if you like iOS go for iPhone"
Positive,Superb phone
Positive,"I am writing my review after 2 months of usage. It's a great phone and works best in apple environment.There is only one drawback is battery, it's not that bad i almost charge my phone after 48 hours but when it is used for heavy purpose, battery drains quickly. Everything else is great. ðŸ‘"
Positive,Phone looks good have a battery issue consuming a lot
Positive,Itâ€™s my 4th iPhone and proudly speaking that all of those are taken from only Amazon. Always got good deals from Amazon with 100% genuine apple products and iPhone is always a iPhone.
Positive,Nice
Negetive,As always the features are great but not for this price range.A lot of other great phones with these similar features within 30k price range.
Neutral,Internet is not working smoothly while network strength is good
Negetive,"Donâ€™t buy this phone has a really serious heating issue , google pixel series is far better than the iPhones go for them"
Negetive,Don't buy this mobile if you are looking for good camera. Currently I am using s23 plus and bought this mobile for my wife as she is looking for some good camera phone. The camera performance is pathetic. It's not at all close to s23 plus. I believe it can't match any samsung cameras performance. Worst experience and never recommend.
Negetive,It's looks old
Negetive,I got the defect phone from this dealer and Amazon refuses to return the product and apple service center least bothered to replace the phone or they need additional 17k to replace... Please buy the phone at outlet or no point spending 80k and roaming around this folks..
Negetive,Even after spending more than half a lakh you still need to spend money for adapter+ earphones ðŸŽ§.It takes a week time to adjust the phone.Worst phone Ever invented in the history of the world.
Negetive,The phone isn't worth 70K by any means. Tue display is a joke. Apple should be ashamed of giving 60Hz display at this price.Only get it for the apple brand otherwise in terms of experience any Android phones above 20K would be better.
Negetive,It is not working properly and battery is getting low
Negetive,Box demage
Negetive,Damage prudoct  no refund order at own risk
Negetive,Software quality is poor. You could find ever more bugs in ios 17. iPhone hotspot is terrible compared to Samsung. Battery needs to be bigger. Display quality is also poor compared to galaxy s10 plus. Display is too little compared to standard size you expect. Battery is degrading fast like going 90% in 10 months.
Positive,Good. Delivered in time
Positive,Good to use.Satiafied with purchase.Camera:10/10Performance:10Product:10
Positive,Switching from an android to an iPhone was one of the best decisions.
Positive,Good Phone

Positive,"I m a first time user of an IPhone, and i can tell if u learn how to use it then it is smooth as butter. The purple colour is so beautiful ðŸ˜»"
Positive,"Everything is good but battery life degraded to 98% in just 2 months. Apple can do much better here. Apart from this everything is good. Check out youtube videos for performance, camera and battery life"
Positive,"Iâ€™m impressed with Iphone. Itâ€™s fast, has a great camera, and the battery life is excellent. A solid upgrade!"

Positive,Amazing experience a well  organised exchange with latest phone

Positive,Love this product
Positive,Awesome variant
Positive,Main advantage is ease of use and performance. Phone never slows down even after your storage is almost fullDisadvantage is too much restrictions on media sharing and storage.
Positive,"Im a first time iphone user, not regretting the decision of switching from android.Iphone just flows. Buy without any doubt.Delivery was poor though."
Positive,"So beautiful,So elegant,just looking like a wow.Seriously you donâ€™t have to read out all comments because it is apple.Everything is outstanding.Value for money depends on user.Otherwise no restriction,just go for it."
Positive,No problem in this mobile 14.Also Quick service from Amazon thanks from Shailesh Nanavati

Positive,A Gem â¤ï¸
Positive,The best mobile to handle nice packaging and delivery claps for amazon
Positive,Value for money
Positive,Itâ€™s superâ€¦.
Positive,"The Apple iPhone 14 (128 GB) in vibrant Yellow is a masterpiece of technology and aesthetics, and it leaves a remarkable impression from the moment one lays their eyes on it. As expected from Apple, the build quality is exceptional, emanating a sense of luxury and durability. Notably, the yellow color adds a unique touch of personality, giving it a refreshing twist over the usual shades. Furthermore, with a storage capacity of 128 GB, the user won't need to worry about running out of space for their apps, music, or memorable pictures.When it comes to performance, the iPhone 14 outshines its predecessors. This device runs seamlessly, even when multitasking between numerous high-demand apps, showcasing the prowess of Apple's latest A16 chip. Also, the updated iOS provides an intuitive, smooth experience for the user, further augmented by the phone's vibrant and sharp display. Remarkably, even after several hours of use, the device maintains its cool, indicating efficient thermal management.Equally worth mentioning is the improved camera system on the iPhone 14. With advanced settings and filters, it captures stunning photos with professional-level detail and color accuracy. In addition, its video capabilities are second to none, making it a perfect companion for vloggers and content creators. In summary, the Apple iPhone 14 (128 GB) - Yellow not only stands out aesthetically but also raises the bar for smartphone performance and features. It's indeed a perfect blend of form and function."
Positive,Best Variant of All. I had tried three variants of 14 plus but this feels best in them all â¤ï¸
Positive,Value for Money
Positive,Nice
Negetive,I have purchased two months back. Battery capacity started reducing. Now it is showing 98% after 1st software updation.
Negetive,"I have bought iphone 14 from Amazon India two months before. but now facing hardware issues such as screen freezes. Now it is completely freezes, touch response gone. So dont trust from online. It may be damaged. Buy only from Authorised Dealer."
Negetive,"The product packaging was looking very old and diamaged condition,there is no invoice for the product."
Negetive,Defective item
Negetive,Bought 2 phones together one Iphone 14 and Samsung S22 in term of spec and durability definitely Samsung won this time. Comparing battery we can say apple does the best job in this series but in term of price its not that much worthful. Could be better designed for such range price.
Positive,This is one of the all rounder excellent quality smartphone I would say.
Positive,"Life changer, thatâ€™s a quality and makes u fit in society"
Positive,"Nothing much to say anything about the Brand, but the Purple Color is beautiful on I-Phone 14. Product came so safely with a secure package. Genuine Product and definitely would recommend to buy it from Amazon."
Positive,Photos Pickup Real Clours.But In Video Cinematic Mode is Awesome ðŸ’¯
Positive,Screen is best in industry
Positive,Amazing phone with amazing camera* must buy one
Positive,Overall a good experience.
Positive,Genuine product with great exchange price
Positive,Excellent
Positive,I was using an XR earlier and the upgrade for me personally is great. But u can go for the 13 if ur on a budget which is available at almost 10k less and has similar features and honestly u cant tell them apart.
Positive,"Product is good,  but package quality is not good"
Positive,"It is just 10 days that I have bought a new iphone 14, it is just getting over heated while using."
Positive,The phone is just perfect and the delivery came before time . The packaging was perfect too .
Positive,dood

Negetive,"the phone heats up abnormally, not a good sign for a brand new phone."
Negetive,Do not buy from Amazon
Negetive,Its just packed in india and still its made in china product .. i wont buy it .. apple is just trying to bluff by just packing it in india!
Negetive,Exchange value is farji thak h sabhi 34000 ka phone 10 mahine age inki rate 7700 laga rahe h thag h
Negetive,"Not satisfied with the overall product, performance issues, need immediate refund so that i can purchase another iphone . ."
Negetive,"Not happy about the product design, features and specification. Have better products available at this price range. Not worth to buy."
Negetive,In thus price range better to go for samsung s24 or ultra apple is remaking the same iphone Xr for years with some changes that's it its a loot businesss
Neutral,"Packaging is not good, I see it has been damaged on the corner. Amazon needs to be more careful while delivering expensive products. Hope it will not happen again."
Negetive,"The bottom speaker sound quality is very bad and service refuse to accept it.  Amazon refused to replace it. Totall waste of money, i recommended not to buy iphone online!!!"
Negetive,"See how the video is shaking while recording! Defective iPhone delivered just 2 days ago, and after asking for replacement, Amazon guys are saying that itâ€™s not their responsibility, better visit a service centre! Now my last resort is left towards consumer forum! Severe harassment!!!A piece of advice must be adhered:Never ever buy expensive product on Amazon!"
Negetive,Gets hanged in 3 months only what is this APPLE
Negetive,"This phone, i phone 14 is performing well, except some features.During calling it became very hot within 10 minutes. Purchased on 21st, applied for replacement on 26th ( last date is 28th), but Amazon refused to replace and wrote the product is out of stock."
Negetive,Last week buy iphone the camera was not working when request for replacement they completely denied and redirect to apple store but why you mentioned 7days replacement???????
Negetive,I bought it on 27 th may from oct 2 charger was not working . I complained to customer care really very worst customer care I have seen not even listening to the problem .really worst experience in Amazon
Negetive,"The display started flickering after just one day of purchasing. On top of that, Amazon is not accepting the return/ replacement request, instead it's asking for different kind of letter which you have to get from the Apple service center. I'm having a very bad experience. I'll highly recommend not to buy any Apple product from Amazon."

Negetive,"I am really disappointed ðŸ™ about the delivery experience! But the product (Iphone 14) , so far so good.I have raised my concern about delivery with the CS team but have yet to receive the update"
Neutral,The I phone look like New. And seam to function like new.On the other hand Verizon had tould me most IPhones sold on Amazon can not be unlocked. The I-14 phone was locked and could Not be unlocked. It took around 13 days to receive the full refund.  It seams like Verizon has problems with Amazon regarding the selling of refurbished iPhones.The phone was in excellent shape. Communication with the seller was great just a bit slow.. and I did receive a full refund.
Negetive,"This phone, despite saying it is for Verizon was NOT unlocked. Still trying to troubleshoot but rather upset. They also list size as 6.7” but it was 6.1” so I already had to return and purchase a different screen protector and case for the phone. Just be aware that the eSIM may not be compatible for Verizon despite the listing saying in multiple places it is unlocked."
Negetive,"The phone was bought in December 2023 for my son for Xmas, we activated it in January and had problems with it not long after that.We went through our cellular service, thinking it was the issue, as it was saying “No SIMS card” and my son was unable to call or use the phone. Verizon would reset the phone and it would work for a little bit and then the same problem would happen again and again.After multiple calls and working with Verizon, they came to the conclusion that the phone was defective in general, which by the time this was decided, it was after the time of the return  window.I had reached out to the seller and I explained the whole situation to them and got no where, they would not even offer a replacement.I contacted Amazon customer service, they had reached out to the seller and got no where.So now I’m paying in a phone thru my Amazon card that now no longer works at all.DO NOT BUY from here!!!"
Neutral,The phone worked fine as a mini tablet.  I went to activate on my phone plan and was shocked to learn that the phone wasn’t paid off by previous owner so it’s not usable as a phone.  Wasted time.
Negetive,"After facing issues with the delivery service basically losing the phone, we got it. The phone was in great shape & looked new. Started the setup & transfer from our previous phone…. Only to find out that the phone was locked by the carrier. Took it to the Verizon store & stayed there for a couple hours while they tried to find a workaround, then to another store to no avail. The seller guaranteed it would work on a Verizon phone but it absolutely didn’t."
Negetive,"The phone does work, however it came with a flimsy, cheap screen protector. Once that was removed (in order to replace with a better one), I discovered it was only applied to hide a 2inch diagonal crack across the surface of the phone. Very deceitful on their part. Highly disappointed."
Negetive,"When I opened the phone, it overall looked fantastic. I was really excited to get it hooked up. When I sat down to activate it, it was locked. It says it works with Verizon but I had to return it because it was locked."
Negetive,The phone could not be added to my Verizon plan because it had an unpaid balance against it.  After lots of headache I am returning.  I pray I have not gotten scammed and will be fully reimbursed.  Will update review if I do not get full reimbursement.
Negetive,I recieved the phone and took to Verizon to transfer my current number to this phone.  It was locked.  There was a sim lock on the phone by the previous carrier.  Stay away from these phones!!!
Negetive,Claim to be not locked and the phone I bought was locked. Went to Verizon and they said it still has payments on it from the previous owner. Trying to return phone and the distributor will not email me back.
Negetive,Wrong information about this
Negetive,la pantalla estaba en pésimo estado
Negetive,"I was unable to activate this phone and visited the AT&T store for assistance.  It is listed in network as ""stolen"" and cannot be activated. 0 stars for my time and aggravation in the process. Never again."
Positive,In general works well but this iPhone 14 freezes in occasions. It happened to me once already. I heard from  some  friends it does that.
Positive,"For an “excellent” condition refurbished, the battery is already at 89% battery health, which to me isn’t excellent. Otherwise it’s great so far."
Negetive,"I moved from an old phone that had a SIM card to the 14 which DOES NOT HAVE A SIM CARD--BEWARE).I had to put in three extra hours of my time to get THis phone to work.  one hour at the Verizon store (be sure to factor frustration and your time st the store into this purchase) where I was told the refurbished phone was big time deactivated by Apple which is why there was a problem.  why I asked?  ""probably because it was stolen"" So if you don't have the stomach for the e sim hassle try a 13 which still has a sim port.  afterward, the phone is working great, worth the extra three hours of my time.  OH, AND THE shipment was missing the charging cable, and the box was crumpled and broken say what?  you need fortitude to move to the esim!!!!!!!!"
Positive,No problem with set up. I am happy with this purchase
Neutral,el telefono vino muy deteriorado por los biseles
Positive,"Replaced an iPhone X, it feels like new and works so much smoother than older phone. No issues with it being pre-used."
Positive,Price was good daughter loves her new phone.. arrived a day early
Negetive,The problem with this phone is that it didn’t hold the internet connection well and didn’t have clear call quality. I constantly lost sound during calls and wasn’t able to be heard. It was worse when I used the Bluetooth connection or speaker. I returned it.Make sure to purchase Amazon fulfillment unless you want to have to contact the vendor yourself. It can be a lot of hassle working to return purchases to the vendor and Amazon doesn’t really do well with A to Z guarantee. I waited over 7 months to receive my refund and I had to work hard with Amazon. Every call was a different story. Finally emailed the VP at the corporate headquarters.
Negetive,Product arrived with many scratches on screen and case. Looks like it has been dropped and damaged. Definitely not in “good” condition.
Negetive,"Aunque el equipo salió muy malo, no pude devolverlo, ya que desde Colombia hay una nueva ley que prohíbe el envío de equipos celulares a Estados Unidos.El equipo tiene muy mala señal y es lento en el funcionamiento. Siento que perdí el dinero."
Negetive,It was a nice phone but I ordered a phone for Verizon (as stated on the order) but I was shipped a phone for ATT!!! Wasted all my time including going in to a verizon store to activate but couldn't activate!! Hope you have better luck then me!!
Positive,"great phone, good camera, good battery. 5 stars."
Positive,"When I received this phone, there was a small scratch on the front near the top corner. Once I put on the Tempered Glass Screen Protector, the scratch was not noticeable. Other than that, the phone works great and was easy to add to my service. The battery is in great shape and charges to 100% which will provide battery life all day. I would buy again from this seller."
Positive,"The camera quality, battery life, and sound quality are just as if the item is brand new! Well worth the money saved and have no worries about buying another refurbished item from Amazon.The phone itself is great, no heat, easy to use, and great size."
Positive,Immediately after taking it from the box I started looking for scratches and blemishes couldn’t find any. It came in bubble wrap in a small box with the packing slip and a new usb cable. Should have come 8/30 but it came on 8/28. I’m super satisfied with my purchase as I turned it on and transferred my items from my phone. Now to get the perfect case.
Positive,"I definitely would recommend this phone.. But with that being said i will lay out the good and the bad of it.Good:- I ordered excellent and the phone came with absolutely no damage, scratches or anything. looked like a brand new phone.- Speakers work perfect- Camera works perfect- phone runs very smoothlyBad:- phone wouldn’t let me transfer from my old phone, could easily be that my old phones an iphone 11 and not as high tech- if you use straight talk, you can NOT do esim. went through hell to get my data transferred.- phone would not let me connect to imessage at first, all i had to do was turn off imsg, power it off and back on and it started working.- battery life is at 88%. but i also knew the risk when i bought the phone.I will definitely say that the phone is amazing and i’m very glad i made the purchase, considering how i was very hesitant to purchase as it’s from Amazon and refurbished. I would recommend purchasing this phone. with that being said i advise if you’re looking to purchase this phone you do!!!"
Positive,"Nice piece of equipment,  the price is wonderful, the only thing I did not know is that it uses an e- sim card ??"
Positive,good
Positive,"El teléfono está en excelentes condiciones internas pero cuando me llegó no trae el cargador solo el cable , hay que aclarar que es eSIM y tiene tecnología 5G. La pantalla traía varios arañazos cuando la condición decía que era excelente. Batería al 100% y trae todas sus partes supuestamente originales, detecta todo bien."
Positive,la verdad es que no tenia muchas expectativas viendo las reseñas de otros usuarios pero en mi caso tuve suerte el telefono practicamente llego como nuevo solo un pequeño rasguño en la parte superderecha pero casi no se nota y tambien llego con el true tone y la bateria al 100%y tambien con la garantia de apple y las camaras sin ningun problema ni con el face id. no tengo quejas pero supongo que tuve suerte en que me llegara en una condicion practicamente nuevo lo recomiendo si pero tenes que tener suerte
Positive,"I bought the excellent quality IPhone 14 128gb and the shipment arrived 2 business days after UPS picked it up. The phone was in near perfect condition minus a few scratches on the screen. However, they’re impossible to see unless you’re in direct sunlight. The main reason why this wasn’t an issue for me is that the phone came with 98% of original battery capacity. Would highly recommend this company for refurbished phones. The only way you’d be disappointed is if you’re unlucky and get a phone that was previously abused by another consumer."
Positive,"Llegó en perfectas condiciones y rápido. Totalmente nuevo, lo recomiendo. Llevo ya unos 4- 5 meses de uso y su estado de la batería se ha mantenido y vino nueva."
Negetive,"Do not buy refurbished phones of any kind f om Amazon they are not compatible with other companies especially Spectrum, had to take a loss on this phone, was able to get over 66 percent of my cost back on trade in on a new IPhone 15 with Spectrum"
Negetive,"Very unhappy, with Apple support for 2 weeks and no resolution. Will request refund as Apple obviously cannot solve softawre issues though confirmed hardware all good. Dissapointing."
Positive,Muy buen producto funcionando perfectamente
Positive,Excelente teléfono de muy buena calidad funcionando bastante rápido con una claridad en la pantalla excepcional su batería tiene una muy larga duración y se recarga muy rápidamente totalmente recomendado
Positive,"No dings, scratches, dents or anything. Can’t tell it’s refurbished. Unlocked like it said. Had for a good 2 weeks now and no issues so far. Came with a charger and screen protector. Upgraded from an iPhone 11.  Had a little trouble connecting to my carrier as this phone is esim only and my old phone had a physical sim. I use straight talk and they got it straightened out in about 30mins to an hour."
Positive,"Phone is of good quality. Battery life is good, easily works through the day. No scratches or marks."
Positive,"Excelente producto, condición de batería 100%, sin rasguños, sin fallas, todo funcionando, podría decir que es un producto totalmente nuevo pero sin caja, recomendado"
Positive,I’m extremely happy with this purchase and delivery was sooner than expected. Set up and transfer procedures were quick n easy. I’d definitely recommend this seller.
Positive,It’s amazing the battery life is good the camera is a bit wonky but I don’t use the camera to take selfie
Positive,"Just updated my wife's iphone 11 to an iPhone 14, and it came unscratched, almost as new, except for the fact that it had a 95% battery life, which is excellent in every way, taking the fact that's it's renewed."
Positive,"Came in 4 days early! The battery health is 100% and it was easy to transfer my cellular service with the help of a Verizon worker. Overall pretty impressed. That being said, I paid for excellent condition and there are a few very tiny but noticeable (at least to me) scratches. Receipt said it was “B+ grade” and I’m happy with it but I don’t feel as though excellent condition suggests there could be any scratches. I’m still very happy for what I paid though!"
Positive,The battery health was 89% was a little disappointing but the phone is in good condition otherwise
Positive,"I received my refurbished Grade A - Iphone 14 on time, in mint condition, and 100% battery life.  I took a chance and I hit the jackpot.  I've had the iphone for 1 week now and all is great."
Positive,Great looking phone out of the box with tiny scratch barely noticeable.  100% battery and easily transferred data from old phone. Great sound and feels sturdy.
Positive,Bateria al 100 pantalla cero rayones solo pequeños pellizcos en 2 esquinas ...exelente unidad muchas gracias  funciona el 100 gracias
Positive,"Hola solo me gustaría resaltar que no llega con ranura de sim física, fuera de eso es una joya. Me llego con 95% de batería"
Positive,LOVE this phone. It is a great price and you are able to make payments. It came in great packaging with a charger too. I purchased the purple iPhone 14 and I inspected it closely- it is in new condition. No scratches or anything. It also came charged and it was easy to set up the eSIM for the unlocked phone.
Positive,"I bought the iPhone 14, 512gb unlocked and it has been working so amazingly well! I love how it came neat and clean in the box! I had no issues sitting it up with my cell phone provider!"
Negetive,"The phone looked all right but the big issue is that it was sent to me without a factory reset. When I charged it (because it was completely out of battery when it got here), it asked for a password in Spanish. I can't speak about the rest of the phone since now I have to take it to someone to get it factory reset for me, but right now I am not very happy about it. Two stars because at least there's no scratches."
Positive,I like the fact I own this phone and my phone bill went from over $100 to just $65 a month
Positive,I like it
Negetive,"It says that it had dual sim slots..However, it only works with e-sim."
Positive,"If you’re like me and update your phone package online to create the best “tab” for your needs, this is for you. I know it’s an up front cost but it beats paying a ton more down the line. Product was in immaculate condition and the 512gb storage has been vital for me as a relatively new content creator. Perfect for all my vlogs, YouTube, etc. keep the monthly bill small and go this route."
Positive,This is the case I needed to be able to charge on the go. It is very durable and makes my phone shine. I’m loving this case.
Negetive,This product was defective. Had to be returned. The cost of shipping was only partially refunded.
Positive,Wonderful
Positive,Me encanto
Neutral,battery percentage was at 88wouldn’t say it came in a perfect condition
Negetive,"I purchased this phone 3 days back, which got delivered today 09/12/2024. But this product turned out to be faulty. While setting up this phone it turned off its own. I tried multiple times but it’s not staying on and goes off after some time. I contacted amazon and they approved my return. I am returning it back just after receiving the same day though I have to wait for refund. Please avoid A4C Seller.."
Negetive,"Unlocked phone was purchased as a gift to be used out of the U.S. Spent $100 at the phone company to transfer data. Speakerphone did not work either normally or on Whatsapp. Spent another $100 to re-transfer data to current phone plus $50 fora new sim card. The cost of the phone is now up to $871. The seller Hybrid-IT contacted me after my review was posted (review suddenly disappeared from my profile). Could not get a local tech willing to service the phone.  The seller's service stinks-really stinks - very time consuming. My calls and message were never returned. As for the phone, it worked other than that critical problem. I returned the phone."
Neutral,"I didn’t get the original charger, and the phone isn’t in excellent condition like it was said. It has a few visible scratches."
Positive,A great phone for the price
Positive,"Like new condition, didn’t have a scratch on it."
Positive,Excellent
Negetive,"There're two large visible scratches on the screen (see picture). The product is advertised as being in excellent condition. If the scratches were on the body of the phone, I'd say it's still a good condition, but on the screen???"
Negetive,Nicks in edges of the phoneScratches on the screen
Positive,"I was really scared as this was my first time buying electronics already used. But this exceed my expectations.The iPhone looks like new. No scratches, screen is perfect. Everything works good.Also I was scared that in the description it says 85% battery health or more. Well, my iPhone’s battery health is 100%.I’m really satisfied with my new iPhone ??"
Negetive,Seller sent me a phone with a camera that does not work.
Negetive,"Bought an iphone 14 back in March, 6 months later phone stops working, says device was reported as stolen. Now idk if seller has a scam operation on not, help would be much appreciated"
Negetive,Bad battery depletes very quickly
Negetive,Don’t buy this from him we got it and the screen keeps flickering now it won’t even show a screen word to my mother I’m getting a refund ????
Positive,Exactly as described. Got this as a gift for my sister and she adores it. I am always wary of purchasing refurbished items but this was so easy and the phone is actually perfect. Yay!
Negetive,Since my other phone had broken since water damage I got this phone and this one doesn’t require SIM card so I went to at&t to set it up and they said they couldn’t and I went the next day to buy a other phone from target and I couldn’t buy it because my at&t account so I went back and the at&t worker said they couldn’t put cellular service and also the phone had been set to 2022 and it had to be set to 2023
Positive,"Je suis vraiment surprise et étonnée de la qualité du iphone.  AUCUN bris, aucune grafigne.  Même pas une trace de doigt.  De plus, batterie à 100% .  Vraiment très satisfaite du produit.  Aucune gêne à recommander.  Envoi et livraison plus rapide que prévu!"
Positive,loooooooove it! way better than I anticipated! easy transfer from my old phone to the new one!!!!
Positive,Excellent product
Positive,Good product as described. Delivery was very quick
Positive,REAL REVIEW…Couple scratches on the sideseverything is fine!
Neutral,"This product dissapoint me a bit because the edges are all scratch. I wouldnt recomend buying this phone on DNCL-TECHZONE because they send phones all scratch and they offer excelent state of the device, and honestly looks like a normal renewed phone and I choose the excelent renewed phone but is far away from excelent. thumbs down :)"
Neutral,"Overall I’m satisfied with the purchase. The screen is cracked and held together by a screen protector but I needed a replacement phone immediately so this will do. The body is dinged up and a scratch on one of the camera lenses. I can overlook those, I think it’s the tiny cracks on the screen that they just put a screen protector over that irk me the most. Not what I would expect when the description was “excellent condition.” I did not mean to purchase an eSIM, because they’re a pain in the butt with Xfinity mobile, so be advised this is an eSIM but yes technically compatible. Probably won’t purchase from here again. I’ve gotten better refurbished electronics elsewhere."
Positive,I wish it was compatible with my phone plan it was so nice but I had to return it
Positive,"Well, I must admit I was very surprised!  I have never bought a refurbished cell phone before and was very worried.  When the “refurbished excellent” phone arrived and we opened it, we saw a wonderful sight…..the phone looked brand new.  It was easy to transfer our old phone to this one.  There was no visible cosmetic damage on the phone.  At this time, we are very happy with our purchase.  Will update if any issues arise.  And, the phone arrived earlier than expected.  Great experience!"
Positive,Loving the phone. Still works fine
Positive,I was happy with my purchase and I’d buy again I’m going forward. People paying thousands of dollars for iPhones is absurd.
Positive,"This phone was a couple hundred dollars cheaper than a new one and when it arrived it looked like new! There were one or two small scratches but the phone worked perfectly in every way, it even came with a screen protected on already."
Positive,I am happy
Positive,Loved it
Positive,Bien
Positive,Arrived on time and in good condition
Positive,Quick response and condition would buy again
Positive,"I was very hesitant to buy this iPhone, fearing it might arrive with something broken or defective. Thankfully, that's not the case! The iPhone is working perfectly so far; I bought mine a month ago. The price was very good, almost half the price of a new one. The battery is at around 97%, so it's working perfectly. Its camera is amazing!! As for the appearance, it's practically intact, except for a tiny scratch near the camera area. However, that doesn't matter to me since the case covers everything."
Positive,The battery health is not so good
Positive,So far The phone works good. there was two small scratches on the front of the phone.
Positive,Super bueno la mejor compra
Positive,"El envío llego super rápido, el teléfono tiene 3 marcas (pequeñas) en la parte frontal del marco. La pantalla está perfecta, la parte trasera excelente, las cámaras igual no hay rayaduras ni marcas. La batería esta al 100% viene desbloqueadoCondicion renovado:excelenteSolo por esos 3 tallones le hubiera dado 5 estrellas. Vino en caja de cartón genérica con su cable de cargaEn la imagen se muestra con ranura para sim card y llego en e-sim."
Positive,"I bought the “good” version. Expecting some scratches because of the new reviews but my iPhone had no scratches at all, packaged well. Doesn’t come with the chargers but that’s no problem bc I have so many at home. Love the blue. Came in only a few days. I bought mine unlocked and it’s been great. Would recommend!!"
Positive,excelente
Positive,Llevo dos meses con el celular y hasta el momento funciona muy bien
Positive,The set up was easy and everything works fine. Battery health came at 100%. Speakers work fine. Only thing is the edges came with some minor scratches but these aren’t noticeable to the common eye
Positive,Easy setup on screen guide. Like new. Unlocked. Generic box.
Positive,came like brand new
Neutral,"Condition (3.5/5): Despite being listed as excellent, my renewed iPhone 14 from Amazon arrived with noticeable scuffs and spots, which was disappointing. The overall condition was not as expected based on the listing.Functionality (4.5/5): On the positive side, the phone’s functionality was not compromised, and it works perfectly fine without any issues like sound quality. The performance is smooth, and all features are functioning as expected including charging. The only negative here was the battery health received was 90%.Suggestion: While the product works well, its appearance is something that can be reflected upfront. It would be beneficial for Amazon to provide exact pictures of the item they are selling in renewed condition. This transparency would help manage customer expectations better and prevent surprises upon delivery.In conclusion, while the iPhone 14 I received functions well, the discrepancy between the listed condition and actual product appearance was a downside."
Positive,I’ve had this phone for half a year now. It was delivered with no scratches and a screen protector. Setting up my Apple account and activating the eSIM was easy as pie.My only gripe with this phone is that most times when I take a photo there’s this faint red line in the center left. It’s been there ever since I got the phone.Other than that I don’t have much to say. It operates like any other iPhone.
Neutral,"I purchased the phone because it was a good price and product description said excellent. Which to me means pretty much like new. Disappointed when it arrived to find scuffs around all 4 corners, but I can deal with that. It's being pretty nitpicky. What I'm really upset about is the fact that a new battery wasn't put in. Couldn't check battery health until I actually logged into the phone and I was extremely irritated to find that the battery health was only 88%. I expect more from an Amazon retailer. If I wanted a not in excellent condition phone, i could have paid less and purchased off the street."
Negetive,"Condition was fine but the IMEI was blacklisted, so it was useless.  They may want to warn customers about this."
Negetive,El celular está bloqueado y no se puede utilizar haci que lo devolví
Negetive,"I have contacted amazon, they refuse to help bc outside the 90 day window (by 2-3 weeks). Waiting to hear back from seller. Will update if they do what’s right"
Negetive,"The condition of the device was as described.However, no one can activate the one I received as it is locked to a previous carrier. This was not a tmobile ready device as it was advertised."
Positive,"Very good, I ordered it in good condition, it arrived very well recommended, what I didn't like very much was that it arrived with 84% battery but it lasts more than 1 day without charging, very good recommended."
Positive,"My son ordered this on my account. Upon receiving it, it was in wonderful condition, but we discovered that it had a digital SIM card and not physical. It wasn’t hard to set it up, just a few more steps other than having to just put in a SIM card. Runs great so far. He’s happy, and he’s a picky consumer! ??"
Positive,I got this phone thinking it would be a used phone and I can barely tell that it is it look feels and works like a brand new phone great buy
Positive,Excellent product
Positive,This is the second phone I have bought through Amazon. Both were great phones. The 14 is a little smaller than my 8+. That’s okay because it will fit in phone pockets I have on some purses. I haven’t notice any difference in the photos it takes yet. The charger sent with it charges really slow. My old block charger is faster. I have ordered a 20W and 30W chargers to try. Even with a lot of things turned off this phone charges slower than my 8+.
Positive,It has been functioning as it should. Well packaged and arrived securely. Good looking as well as working phone. Thanks much.
Neutral,"Happy with the phone, but not happy with the scratch’s it came with on the camera .I bought this as excellent condition, expected better for the money"
Positive,Arrived on time and in like new condition. I was able to set it up and transfer my service and phone number from T-mobile. Saved lots by getting a 14 instead of a 15. I compared the choices and am glad I saved a bunch by not going for the Pro model.
Positive,"I have purchased two phones from this vendor.  Both phones had no scratches or nicks and looked as good as new.In addition to the physical condition of the phones, both phones had 100% battery health.  What more could you ask for!"
Positive,"This seller has great communication. Spoke to the seller the entire process and they made this a great experience. The phone came in perfect condition, had no issues connecting the eSIM with T-Mobile. No marks or scratches on the screen or body. Inspected the phone completely and everything matches up well."
Negetive,"I have had this iPhone for 38 days.It has the worst battery life of any iPhone I've ever owned, and I have owned ONLY iPhones since the first version was released 17 years ago.This is the second iPhone 14 that I've bought from the renewed store .The first one I bought on December 4th, 2023, and I could not have been happier with the phone.It arrived in brand new condition, and performed flawlessly.On the recommendation of a friend, I checked the battery health and charging after having it for MONTHS and it was at 100%! I was thrilled!I absolutely loved the phone!I never had a single problem with it.Unfortunately, on July 30 of this year I dropped it, and it was beyond repair.I immediately went back to the Amazon renewed store and purchased another iPhone 14 because my experience with the first one was so fantastic.It arrived in new looking condition, exactly like the one I bought in December 2023.It was not scratched or anything really noticeable, it just seemed to be ""worn"" a little bit, but I fully understood that it was a renewed phone, and any cosmetic issues were not that important to me, including the color, which, when my iPhone is in its case, you cannot tell what color it is anyway.Unfortunately, I DID NOT look at the battery health and charging when I first got the phone 38 days ago, but I did look at it about two weeks ago, and it said 93%.I thought, ok, it's a renewed phone, it's not going to have 100% battery life.I can live with that.Well, I just looked at it today and it's now at 90% battery health and charging.So this phone is dying quickly.After being fully charged it dies within hours.I have it completely set up for optimized battery life.I have lost emails and messages that I was in the middle of composing, and the phone just dies.I've been in the middle of important phone calls when the phone dies, simply because I had just fully charged it a few hours before that, and thought I would be fine for hours to come.I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery a week ago, and I was on the phone with my doctors office yesterday about my first post-op appointment, and my phone died in the middle of it.I thought I had HOURS left before the phone would die.Then I had to plug it in, and wait for it to come back alive, so I could call my doctor back and hopefully not wait a half hour after losing my place in line.On top of that is also has issues with the touchscreen being glitchy, and sometimes I have to tap on things several times to get them to work.As I said, I have been an iPhone owner/user since the very first version came out 17 years ago.I've always loved all my iPhones, and I will continue to be an iPhone user for the rest of my life.This is in no way reflection on Apple iPhones whatsoever.They are an amazing and fantastic piece of technology.I think I just got a bad one for the first time in my life.Luckily, I have just checked and I have until November 6th to return this phone, and I WILL be returning it.The problem is, what do I do in the meantime?Am I expected to buy a new one and get that shipped to me, transfer all my information from this phone to the new one, and then return this one?That is extremely hard to do financially!I am actually still paying for this phone on my Amazon Prime American Express card!Or, do I return this phone and wait until the refund has been issued and then buy another phone? Then wait until that is sent to me.I would not have a phone for at least a week in the interim, and we all know these days that's a practical impossibility.I am also having several medical issues.Like I said, I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery last Monday, September 9th, and have several upcoming follow up appointments, and physical therapy appointments.I also have several other non-related medical issues that definitely require that I have a phone.I just don't know what to do."
Positive,"Like most, I was skeptical about ordering refurbished. I have ordered refurbished/renewed in the past and of course it’s give and take! The first thing I did when I received my phone was look for cosmetic issues. There was barely any at all! The phone looks practically new! I had a iPhone 12 mini and wanted something a little bigger/upgrade. Everything transferred flawlessly. I made test calls with no issue. Good speaker sound, runs smooth and it came charged at 91% and has 100 percent battery capacity which was awesome! I received the phone on the 27th and it has been working great! I will keep this seller in mind for any future references! If you have any second guesses, no worries! I read the reviews before purchasing. There were more good than bad. You always take a chance buying renewed devices, but according to the reviews, anyone who had to return a device did so with no issues and always received good replacements. I hope this information helps for anyone needing a refurbished device at a great cost!"
Positive,This is the 4th renewed iPhone 14 I've bought for my family. All have worked great. Twice I've reached out to customer service and both times they responded within a couple hours. All phones had a new battery. The worst battery rating of these phones showed 98% while the other 3 showed 100%. All phones are shipped promptly via Fed Ex and were received in 2-3 business days.
Negetive,"UPDATE: After speaking to a very helpful agent at Loop Mobile, the company who deals with these refurbishments, I discovered my phone was still under warranty and they would replace for free. However I needed to send my phone in first, before they would ship me a new one. I use my phone for work so this is a problem, but I can make it work for a few days. I'm told the turnaround is very fast too, so I figure I'm looking at a week maximum.Due to a tracking error on FedEx's end, it takes them longer to process my return, so it's nearly a week and a half before I get my new phone. And then when I get it, it's set up for TMobile, not AT&T so I can't even use it. And all attempts to call this week have been met with a message of ""no available agents, call back later"". They have been relatively fast to respond via email, but honestly, this has been such a mess I'm wishing I had just spent some extra money for a new phone. I know there is always a risk with refurb items, but I've rarely had issue and when I do they are resolved quickly.I purchased a refurbished iPhone 14 in August of last year and it was working great with no issues. It was a like new phone. However, in the last few days I've started getting ""Unknown Battery"" messages and my phone will turn off at random multiple times throughout the day, to the point where I don't feel confident making phone calls with the phone for fear of them being dropped.I went back to the order to see what my options were in terms of warranty and tech support, and it's EXTREMELY convoluted. It's hard for me to even tell if I qualify for the 90 day guarantee or the 1 year, because my phone was classified as ""new"" but the Amazon site only lists guarantees for conditions which are premium, excellent, or acceptable. When I tried to chat with someone I found my message was sent over to Loop Mobile, who must be the third party company who actually refurbished the phone. But it's unclear who I need to contract to see how to get this fixed or if I just need to pay out of pocket. I haven't even had the phone a year, so it's a disappointing development for what has otherwise been a great phone."
Positive,There is nothing to dislike about this phone.
Neutral,"I was super excited to get this phone and it seemed to work great! But then I noticed a lot of issues when it came to downloading or uploading files, pictures, or videos. Including just trying to save a picture sent via text, trying to add a picture to make a collage in an app, basically anything dealing with “selecting” media. It’s incredibly inconvenient ??"
Negetive,"Came in good condition, arrived early, and turned on just fine. However, AT&T had it marked as missing or stolen. More than likely the previous owner did not pay it off. Spend the extra few dollars to purchase it unlocked to save yourself from the hassle of returning your phone."
Positive,Excellent product
Positive,was skeptical of a refurbished phone but after getting it i am very impressed so far it was like buying a new phone at half the price went from an iPhone 8 to a 14 and it works wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!
Negetive,Phone arrived with one scratch on back but looked nice overall. The touchpad worked intermittently and made it difficult to manipulate screens. Right off the bat the phone is locked and I couldn’t add it to my service from home. My provider at straight talk checked emei number to activate it and suggested I take it to an AT&T store for help because it is locked. Zack the AT&T associate was of no help claiming they had no way to unlock the phone. Said he could sell me a new one though. Amazon accepted the request for a return. With a conditional dollar amount pending review of the phone. Hoping I get all of my money back.
Positive,"I was a little skeptical about a renewed phone, but there were no scratches, it appeared perfect. The battery health is at 100%, it is the same as a brand new phone. The packaging obviously wasn’t original from Apple, but it was very nicely and professionally done. Thank you so much!"
Positive,"Such a great product, like new!"
Positive,es super bueno caja generica y tu recibo y instrucionnes por si quisieras devolverlo
Positive,Works perfectly
Negetive,The phone is corrupted and cannot be fixed. The Esim did not work nor did the Cellular app on the settings page. Apple tech support looked into it through their number and said it was broken. WHY ARE YOU SELLING BROKEN PHONES??
Negetive,"No me deja poner el iCloud en el celular, dice que muchas veces han puesto iCloud en el telefono"
Positive,Described perfectly
Positive,I love it! The phone is perfect and there was no complications with connecting it to my phone provider. I got excellent condition and there are a few small scratches on the screen but not bad.
Positive,The phone is new for all intents and purposes. Great sound quality. No defects that I can see. Not a scratch. Pleasantly surprised. Fingers crossed.
Positive,Gbaby live the upgrade -reliable fast bright colors and keeps a great charge she loves the phone
Positive,I got the iPhone 14 in purple for my daughter and it arrived 2 days earlier than expected in almost perfect quality with just slight scratches on the camera (didn’t take away from the breathtaking photos) and that was nothing camera covers couldn’t fix.
Positive,"The battery started at 100% and it hasn't deteriorated at all in the two months I've had it. However, the facial recognition is very flaky. I wear glasses and a mask sometimes and i have face ID set up both these things yet it doesn't work half the time. I find myself manually putting in my passcode multiple times a day. The phone works just fine, although the top part of the screen isn't very touch sensitive"
Positive,It came in amazing shape it had not a single scratch no signs of scratching or damage
Positive,Wife loves it
Positive,The apple iphone line has always been successful because of it's vast ecosystem and seamless user experience. We upgraded from the mini series which we loved a lot and hopefully apple reintroduced a small form factor. Otherwise the phone boasts great battery life and the features are always top notch.
Positive,Works just like new! Checked the battery health and it was 100 percent. Definitely worth the purchase and saves you a lot more money. Only difference between this and a new iPhone is that you might not get the original charger or box but that doesn’t matter to me.
Positive,"Phone looked like it is brand new, couldn’t find any flaws and works great!"
Positive,battery @ 100% & kooks like new
Positive,"I got a black t-mobile locked 256gb iPhone 14, it was in such excellent condition I really couldn’t tell it wasn’t brand new! Would highly recommend this over overspending on a new one from your carrier."
Positive,Muy bien solo que no venia en caja
Negetive,"I received the phone as expected and it looked great. I was able to set it up at home and connect it to my AT&T account just fine. Or so I thought. The next day my phone gets shut off so I have no service at all. I go into AT&T and they check out the phone and have it turned back on temporarily but send out a work order to see what’s going on. I got a call later that day from the store manager of my local AT&T that the phone has been marked stolen, which is why it was getting shut off. Someone sold the phone and stopped making payments on it so AT&T tagged it as stolen. This phone was supposed to have gone through Amazon’s refurbishing system. Ha. Just don’t buy from here."
Positive,"The only problem was it was so outdated, the updates took forever. Ever since, it's been smooth sailing. Good quality phone and I like the price. Would go this route again."
Negetive,"The iPhone itself works fine, but after a week of use the adapter started smoking while plugged in and the cord itself is completely melted. This is really dangerous and I hope the seller will look into their cords. Hope no issues will arise with the phone itself"
Positive,This phone arrived in great condition with a charger included. Absolutely nothing wrong with it! And it was such a great price. There is a 90 day warranty in case anything goes wrong.
Negetive,I bought this phone and when I took it with my phone company for a sim card. The phone was blocked like it was stolen. Sent it back and haven received my refund in more than and month
Negetive,this was supposed to be in excellent condition but it was not there are so many dents on this phone!
Negetive,"I bought it in good condition. I paid $450 but many scratches on the screen (small scratches), camera lenses also edge of the iPhone damage. I'm gonna return it. I'm not happy with this purchase."
Negetive,I just spent over $600 on a new phone and they sent me some garbage 3rd rate charger. Very disappointed
Negetive,This phone was advertised as AT&T compatible but the AT&T store I took it to said it was definitely not compatible.  So I had to return the phone and now waiting on my refund.  The wrong advertising created a big hassle for me.
Negetive,Sold me a stolen iPhoneZero stars
Negetive,Do not bother to waste your time buying this. You are better off spending the money and buying a phone new to avoid this massive headache
Negetive,Phone was block listed from att and reported stolen
Negetive,The phone was in great condition however when we contacted AT&T to activate the phone they told us it was stolen.  They recommended returning to Amazon to avoid further issues.  I have processed a return and expect a full refund from this third party seller.  I have also contacted Amazon to report the seller.
Positive,"Good offer, perfect condition total recommend."
Positive,"you’re getting an amazing deal! i was really nervous at buying first thought it was a scam but i was definitely proved wrong! i bought a black iphone 14 but the seller reached out to me saying they were out of stock in black and gave me the choice for another color or to cancel, obviously i chose another color. had a situation where the blue cost less then the black. but the seller refunded me what i was owed, they were VERY sweet and understanding!! as far as the phone goes it’s like brand new, even the battery life on it is at a 100!!"
Negetive,Sold me an iPhone that was locked because the previous user sold Amazon an iPhone with an owed balance.
Negetive,"Disappointing, works only off cell network and not wifi. Now we are stuck trying to fix it. If Apple can't help, will need to return."
Negetive,The phone will transfer any of my data or download any updates. It’s a $600 paper weight
Positive,Soooo glad I went with a refurb instead of new. I saved like $250 and upon opening up my phone there were zero scratches and the battery life is 100%. It’s basically brand spanking new. I am a very happy customer!
Positive,"Phones were in great condition, plus the price was right."
Negetive,I am disappointed in how the phones paint was chipped when it arrived. The phone was at 1 percent battery when it arrived also. The phone is great and works fine.
Positive,"It came in early and the battery was practically brand new at 98%. No scratches on the phone or anything, definitely recommend!"
Positive,Excelente condición fácil  para activar estoy muy satisfecha y lo recibí antes de lo esperado lo recomiendo ????
Negetive,We ordered an iPhone 14 that was supposed to be in good condition. It arrived with a broken camera. It looks as if the camera was clumsily repaired and tried to pass off as being fully functional.  We are sending the phone back for a refund.
Positive,Product came faster than expected and in perfect condition would definitely buy again!
Positive,"Me llego como nuevo, sin raspaduras en la pantalla y la batería 100%,por ahora a trabajado muy bien, y el precio no se diga."
Negetive,"After 6 months of using the phone, one day it stopped connecting to my mobile service provider. My mobile service provider said they can't do anything because it shows someone locked the phone and I should contact the seller. Seller is no where to be found now."
Negetive,This phone was NOT unlocked. I was forced to spend extra money to get a usable phone.
Neutral,This is the first time I have ever purchased a refurbished iPhone. That has given me problems from the start. has quirky problems too many to explain in this article.
Positive,"Great condition, like-new refurb.  When I tried to transfer my old iphone to the new iphone 14, it failed because T-Mobile had a fraud-lock on the new iphone 14.  It took 2 days dealing with T-Mobile to remove the fraud-lock so that I could use the new iphone.  No one could explain why the Amazon refurb iphone 14 had a fraud-lock on it."
Positive,This is my second phone off of refurbished Amazon and I love it. I had my XR since 2020. Now today upgraded to the 14. No scratches. Prestine condition. 100% Battery health.
Positive,"This iPhone has got to be one of the best ones I’ve ever bought refurbished and I have bought four refurbished iPhones. There were no cracks scratches no screen burn-in, the camera is immaculate. There’s no scratches in the camera. And the battery capacities at 100%! simple and easy set up. these photos here that I have the first one is from when I bought the phone in December and this is a screenshot from April 20 24 about five months after I bought the phone. Out of all refurbished iPhones, I’ve had this has kept battery life the longest."
Neutral,"The phone itself was in excellent condition with a few scratches to indicate it is a used product. However, the battery was at only 90% and dropped down to 89% after one weekend of use. My 5 year old iPhone is at 83% and the battery is at its deathbed. So, if the battery, screen, and phone case/housing hasn’t been “renewed” what has? Isn’t it just a “used” phone?"
Positive,Looks brand new no scratches or anything on it love ??my new phone thank you seller ??
Positive,She loves it
Positive,"Fast deliver, and good shape."
Positive,"Item was like new no scratches or blemishes . plThere were no scratches or blemishes, received earlier than stated when placed order"
Neutral,"The product was good easy quick set up however there’s some damage on the sides regarles of paying for excellent finish, the battery life was 80% 2-3 scratches on screen however the price was good for it being the 14"
Positive,I might be a little biased because it’s my first ever iPhone but I absolutely love it !! It’s amazing and in great shape the camera is amazing
Positive,"I love, love the product it work great."
Positive,"Beautiful phone.Battery life 100%.pricey but you get what you paid  for.I’ve had this phone for a few months and have had no problems.Battery has lasted days instead of my old phone which wouldn’t last a day without recharging.Don’t be afraid to order one of these refurbished phones,my came and you couldn’t tell it wasn’t brand new.Highly recommend"
Neutral,"The product is good for sure.Battery health was at 87%, it disappointed me. Few scratches on the hardware. Acceptable, but definitely it could be better."
Positive,I loved this! came looking exactly as new. I bought this to be used in Costa Rica my service provider had no issues adding the eSIM to it. Battery is 100% works and looks just awesome is fully unblocked. Great choice! wont spend more money buying a new cell phone from any store in the future.
Positive,"I’m happy I purchase this phone. The phone came earlier than expected (within 2 days). The phone is in excellent condition not one scratch, ding etc. The set up was easy. The phone has an esim card, so make sure your service provider supports esim. It cost $20 bucks to activate the esim. The set up was easy. I used the move to iOS app to transfer all of my data over. Additionally I had the phone checked out by apple for free. I was able to purchase AppleCare with the replacement insurance through apple. The phone is smooth no lag or software issues. I saved $150 by purchasing this phone used. I am overly satisfied with this purchase."
Positive,I Like That It’s Literally Perfect For Me. I Dislike It Came In A Android Box I Was So Nervous But Overall I Love My New Phone I Transferred Everything From My Old Phone To This One Perfectly Fine With No Help From A Carrier.
Neutral,"Everything is good so far, but it keeps heating up, the phone feels physically hot. I’m not sure if this is a technical problem. I’ve only been on one app and it keeps exiting."
Negetive,"This was labeled as refurbished-excellent and I’ve had Amazon refurbished products and this is not excellent (probably whatever is right below excellent). There’s scratches on places I don’t think should be if it’s “excellent”. I removed the screen protector they put on and noticed the scratches were on the actual screen and around the front camera. The actual device works just fine though. If I had another phone, I would return this one and try again."
Negetive,"I am unhappy with the seller, who refused to help with the battery replacement, or a swap. The phone arrived with 100% battery life, and in 90 days, is now only able to charge to 84% capacity.I didn't ask for a refund, just a swap or a new battery. Oh but, it's just outside the 90 days, the phone just started showing warning messages about the battery; so he refused to help.The phone is now giving prompts about it is having issues. I don't recommend this; it's frustrating to see such a problem on a phone marketed as refurbished.When I asked him to help, they refused. So if you do decide, double check the batteries after a few days."
Positive,"As described, phone shows no evidence that it ever was used! An earlier watch I purchased was also perfect. Not from this supplier. One star off. It was covered with fingerprints, I don’t think it is asking too much to clean the phone. My other phone was clean!"
Positive,"Los dos teléfonos vinieron con el 100% de batería, sin detalles en perfectas condiciones. Estoy muy contento"
Positive,"Phone is like new, in excellent condition, everything works well. Camera works great, screen has no scratches. The only flaw was one small scratch on the side of the phone but no big deal, my phone case will cover it. Best part is that the battery life is at 100% I am extremely happy with my purchase, the blue color is beautiful!"
Positive,Very happy!!!!
Positive,"The batery is 100% renewed, and the post sale service was very useful"
Neutral,"I bought this phone on the “excellent” condition, but I am very disappointed in the quality. The phone itself had dirty ports, and the lens had these weird scratches on the metal. The screen also have a few deep scratches and scuffs. Battery life is at 86% which is less than ideal. They should show the picture of the actual product so costumer's have an idea on what they’re buying."
Neutral,The phone is actually pretty good but it had scratches like someone used sand paper to scratch it
Neutral,"Got the “excellent” condition phone. It came dirty like it was just taken out of someone’s pocket. I didn’t mind cleaning it up, but if you do just keep that in mind. Upon cleaning there was a deep scratch in the screen that some might even consider a crack. It was about a centimeter long so i can see how it was overlooked. But I was expecting a bit better for excellent quality. Other than that the phone itself works great and battery health was 95% when i checked the settings. It is decent for the price if you don’t mind the things I mentioned"
Positive,Buenas condiciones recomendadas
Negetive,I thought I could trust the reviews on this one but I’m pretty disappointed with how it came. It had tons of scratches on the front (some of them feel deep) and a bunch of random white stuff on the sides. It also came with 90% battery health which isn’t bad but not what I expected after I picked the “excellent” condition option. I would look at other refurbished brands because this one wasn’t it.
Positive,"The price was nice. Not sure if it is an unlocked iPhone or jail broken. Shows signs of being jail broken, but still a good purchase."
Positive,Phone came and works fine. No issues. Surprisingly it all went pretty smoothly and cost a lot less than going directly through your phone service provider.
Positive,"There were no scratches or any damage it work perfectly fine too. The camera works fine too, it wasn’t hard to add my cellular or anything else in here too good product.The photo quality is good too :)"
Positive,"i think it’s definitely worth your buck, but i think the labels on how it comes it’s a little off. i got the excellent one, and it had a scratch on the screen. not a big deal, but i figure if there was a scratch, it would be on the back of the phone not anywhere on the screen. i had a small scratch with kind of annoyed me. still a great option but i would just be weary on the condition you want your phone"
Positive,"Pleasant Experience.  Seller processed order quikly, shipped quickly, and product arrived as advertised.  Thanks!~"
Positive,I purchased the this item in acceptable and this came basically brand new
Positive,"I can't believe how great this phone is! It came brand new with all the accessories I needed, including a bonus phone case. The battery is at 100% capacity, which is amazing. And to top it off, it arrived earlier than expected! I couldn't be happier with my purchase."
Positive,La verdad muy conforme! Funciona perfecto
Negetive,"I purchased this phone for my daughter for Christmas. It’s May and the phone is garbage. After it got stuck in an update we took it to the Apple Store where they diagnosed several critical hardware malfunctions. The phone was never properly registered by the seller and shows a purchase date of March 31, 1978 so the Apple Store won’t even touch it. I purchased the Asurion insurance for $170 and that was a joke. It took 2 hours to file a claim because they didn’t have a yellow IPhone 14 listed as a product in their system. Finally got the claim filed. Do I get a replacement? No I pay $99 and get a shipping label to return the phone to them. They will send me an Amazon gift card for the cost of phone minus taxes. So 5 months after getting the phone I’m out $300 and in 10 days I’ll have an Amazon gift card.Worst investment. For an extra few hundred, buy directly from Apple or your phone carrier. What a joke."
Positive,I was skeptical on purchasing but for the price I took the chance! Extremely satisfied with my purchase! Works perfectly no flaws & cheaper than apple!
Positive,Phone came early and was in great shape!
Negetive,Ordered it because my phone broke and this advertised quickest shipping when comparing stores here and elsewhere on the internet. Shipping method used meant a later delivery date. Would have gone elsewhere if shipping times were correctly advertised
Positive,"Thanks to customer service. I was able to set up this phone eSIM immediately after receiving accurate instructions from the seller. I appreciate the quality of this phone. Everything is working spectacular. Thanks once again, and Well Done."
Neutral,The product description should state that it doesn't have a sim because it's internationally unlocked and not all countries have the e sim facility.
Positive,I haven't fully completed the set up on the phone yet but I would consider it to be in excellent condition. No scratches on the camera lens or the screen. There are a few minor cosmetic issues but it's so small that it's not even noticable unless you're really looking for it.
Positive,Great product
Positive,Like that u can’t tell they are a renewed product they look and work perfectly so thank u
Positive,This iPhone is in perfect condition. So good I bought for my wife.
Positive,It came on time and works great
Positive,The phone is in perfect condition.
Positive,"El teléfono en muy buen estado , esta funcionando , pero vino con un cargador y cable no compatible hizo un ruido al ponerlo a cargar..de resto parece todo ok"
Negetive,Nice iPhone 14 and looks brand new. It was supposed to be unlocked and renewed. I have no idea on how they didn’t know the phone is locked to a carrier and nothing I can do about it but return the device. Definitely was not what I expected. Totally an inconvenience at this time. I hope the exchange can make this transaction right and complete.
Positive,"It was time to upgrade my cell phone, so naturally I reached out to my carrier.  They didn’t show a cash only price, just the amount of the monthly payment and for how many months.  When I did the math I was astonished!  I felt like there was a better deal to be had,  I got my last iPad from Amazon, so I checked them out.  For nearly HALF of what our carrier was asking, I purchased a renewed phone. It looks brand new and I’ve been enjoying it for several weeks now with flawless performance.  I will never purchase new again!"
Positive,Perfect condition. Works as it should. Price was fair.
Positive,"I’m not gonna lie at first I was scared that I would receive a broken and dirty old phone but when it said “excellent condition” it meant excellent. It came in two days early and I was surprised to see it looked brand new with no scratches and bumps anywhere that I could see. The phone itself worked perfectly and came in at a nice 96% battery life so it’s not perfect but it’s up there. The box and accessories were kinda cheap and not so great but I was upgrading from my old iPhone SE so I had spares around. Overall as of I'm writing this,this phone works perfectly fine and almost brand new, the price wasn’t the best but it was certainly cheaper than a brand new one. The only gripes I have is the phone came in kind of full of smudges from a wipe and it was a pain to set up the eSIM but it’s not too bad and just takes some effort. I would highly recommend buying this iPhone from this seller and I am probably gonna buy from here again when I need to upgrade but honestly I’m quite happy with my purchase."
Positive,Love it
Positive,Me gustó porque muy buenas condiciones
Positive,Phone in exa excellent condition no marks or scratches. 100% battery health.Speaks are very loud. Camera quality A1.
Positive,"No scratches, like new."
Positive,"The packaging was very secure, Im very satisfied with the product. Its good as new, looking forward to do business with you again"
Positive,I love it this is my second time buying a refurbished iphone & i couldn’t be more happy with it ?? it came with no scratches works perfectly fine and it arrived fast !!
Positive,I was hesitant to buy a refurbished phone. The mixed reviews didn’t help either. The phone came in perfect condition. Not a single scratch on it. The battery is at 100 percent. I bought to replace my XR. I didn’t feel like spending $800-900 for the 15. I have no complaints!
Positive,"Looks good , works great.Battery life is 88%"
Positive,"Updated review: I had to return this phone as it didn’t work properly after only having it about a month and a half. It would be fine for days to a week or so, but then would shut its self off randomly despite how much charge the phone had. Then would turn its self on, & repeat this process until the battery completely died & got very hot. This happened about 3 times before I was able to actually initiate the return. Even though I had to return the phone, I’m leaving 4 stars because customer service was great. I was able to get a complete refund very easily. They made the return process very quick & smooth & was issued a full refund as soon as they received the phone in the mail. I purchased from this seller in the past, & would still use this seller again.This phone came in almost brand new condition. There was one super small 2 mm scratch on the screen, but it is not deep, barely noticeable & does not affect function.Cameras are great, battery life came at 99%, holds a charge very well!!Overall great phone, & got here quick.It did not come with an Apple charger, but the listing says that it does not. This is not a big deal to me at all, as I have a bunch laying around. This is the second time I’ve bought a phone off Amazon & I have not been disappointed either time (the last one lasted 6 years & I just upgraded to this iphone)."
Positive,Phone in good condition
Positive,"I’ve had my iPhone 11 for a whileeee— I’m pretty good with phones, only buy them when I absolutely have to. I considered financing thru my carrier but I like my low phone bill & didn’t want to add $30 for 3 years. I honestly didn’t realize I was buying a refurbished phone until after I paid, but I was really impressed. Aside from the tiniest scratch at the bottom of the phone screen, it is in perfect condition. Took a few tries to get the eSIM activated, but it’s been pretty seamless thus far. Got a great phone for a fraction of the price & there soooo much storage.. really happy with my purchase."
Positive,"Looked great out of the box, very minimal issues which aren’t really noticeable. The issue I had was the phone was not keeping a charge."
Positive,"So far, so good. Liked that it was fully charged when it arrived.  Didn’t like that there were no instructions with it."
Positive,"Love it, looks brand new and works great no issues. Way better price than a brand new one. Great deal!"
Positive,"Good condition, battery is ok but it overall is good."
Positive,Worked great
Positive,First time getting a refurbished iPhone. Item arrived on time today in excellent condition. Thanks so much!
Negetive,"Update: I was issued a full refund. I'm going to try to order again.""The phone is otherwise in great condition, but is completely unusable as it was marked as stolen by AT&T, and they would not let me transfer service. I will update my review when/if I'm given a full refund or replacement. Do you really have no way of checking if a phone is stolen?"""
Positive,I loved the fact that the phone arrived quickly and the price was more affordable. The device works amazing and I love my new phone.
Positive,"The glass plate protector was chipped. They promised a new one in the mail. Poor quality control. I remove it and found 2 small scratches, and decided I was not going to return it that a new cover glass would probably hide them. So can’t give them five stars.  Still waiting on the new protective glass cover they promised."
Positive,USB doesn’t work
Positive,"At first I was a little hesitant on purchasing a used iPhone 14 that could potentially have small signs of wear and a slightly deteriorated battery. But, to my surprise this phone is quite literally brand new. Not a single sign of any micro scratches, and a battery health of 100%. I payed $600 saving me $200 from a new one and it was so worth it. I most certainly recommend anyone to buy a renewed iPhone 14 through amazon, especially if you're a little hesitant."
Positive,"A very nice phone. My other one was a 7 iPhone. This one is a 14 so quite a bit difference . I love it. I just heldit next to my old Phone and it transferred my stuff to the new phone. Beautiful. I am lucky. My husband knows about phones so he can help me if I come across something I don't know about, but it isn't complicated. Thanks Amazon."
Negetive,When trying to activate the eSIM I found out that the phone had an unpaid balance on a different AT&T account. Therefore it could not be used on my AT&T account. It had been reported as lost or stolen. Also the battery maximum capacity was only 88%.
Negetive,"Once transferring my old number to the phone, I received an unpaid installment att plan warning from my carrier. This means I am unable to use the phone as it was intended to be used: as a phone. Now I need to wait two business days for the seller to reach out then 1 week for an investigation to be completed. This is extremely frustrating as I now do not have any working device. Additionally, the phone came with a USB charger; who uses a USB connected to an Apple device? As things stand now, I advise you to purchase a new phone elsewhere.*UPDATE: I received a message from the seller regarding this. Apparently there is no process by which they check to see if the phones they have in their inventory are paid off and released by their initial owners. This business seems very sketchy and I highly advise against utilizing their services."
Negetive,The phone would only stay on for 2 minutes at a time before restarting.
Negetive,"La entrega fue dentro del tiempo,más sin embargo lo dejaron en el piso en día de lluvia, más sin embargo indicaron que lo dejaron en el buzón de residencia , y no fue así."
Neutral,I picked a refurb in excellent condition but received a phone with many large scratches as well as LED burn in on 1/4 of the screen. I don’t mind the dents on the case portion but there are too many noticeable blemishes on screen to say this phone is even in good condition.
Positive,Shipping was extremely fast. I am happy with the price compared to going through t mobile. Switching my SIM card over was extremely easy. The quality is great I would have never guessed it was refurbished. So far I have 0 complaints.
Negetive,Can’t hardly hear anything. This phone clearly has water damage
Positive,Honestly was a little skeptical buying but I’m 100% happy with my purchase 89% battery life no scratches phone is very clean don’t dents or cracked glass phone works like brand new I would definitely buy again which I am buying my wife one soon upgrading from iPhone 11 to a 14 definitely a great deal about the same price as my iPhone 11 was 2 years ago
Positive,This phone is almost like new from the package. I love it. It's so beautiful.  Works more than fine. Will be shopping again.
Negetive,"Bought an ""excellent condition"" certified renewed iPhone 14. Third party seller sent me a nice looking phone, but after fully setting it up I find out it's blacklisted by AT&T because it's an unpaid device, meaning the original owner never paid for it in full or paid off the installment plan. AT&T turned off my cell service before I could switch back to my old phone, had to drive to AT&T store to reactivate my old phone so I could return this one. Had to wait a week for a refund before I could get my money to go buy a new phone elsewhere. Will never buy used again. Clearly sellers are not checking the items they send out. Total waste of time."
Positive,Love the phone
Positive,Repackaged. Not original wrapping.A great deal.
Negetive,"They sent me a beautiful phone looks brand new but it was black listed, so not cool, refunded fairly quickly."
Positive,"Everything was fully functional out of the box, only complaint is that the screen had a few more scratches than i would prefer, and the battery was at 88% health. Not too bad but could be better"
Neutral,"El teléfono estéticamente está bien, solo tiene unos pequeños rasguños en los costados. Funciona bienLo único que no me parece bien es el estado de la batería para ser un reacondicionado excelente el estado de la batería está muy mal"
Positive,I’m happy with my iPhone 14. It looks as good as new. It has good battery life and works well. The touch screen is sharp.
Positive,Todo perfecto
Positive,It’s good clear easy to use. I use it for personal and business
Neutral,"I ordered what it was supposed to be an ""excellent"" product, and although it seems to be impecable on the outside, it came with battery capacity at 82% only."
Positive,"Omg, it’s so perfect. No scratch or scuffs. The battery life is 100%. I can’t believe it. I’m so happy with this purchase."
Positive,"I like this phone. Battery health is good, cameras are good. Easy and comfortable to use"
Positive,"The product was exactly what I hoped it was.No issues at all, and I love the long battery on it. Props to the seller for getting this one right."
Positive,"Excellent condition, two small scratches that I do not mind came unlocked really satisfied.!"
Positive,Lo único que me indica que el teléfono era renovado y no nuevo es la caja y el papel que te envía Amazon diciendo que es renovado. De otra manera el teléfono estaba al 100%
Negetive,"What to expect paying full excellent price condition phoneWhat you getChipped screen , probably aftermarket oneSeveral scratchesAnd  average battery healthBEWARE of this “Renewed” phonesCant make this clear enough!!!"
Negetive,"The physical appearance of the phone was in perfect condition, but I was never able to complete the data transfer from the old phone to a new phone.  Fully charged the phone, updated the iOS and tried more than 10 times and the phone would power off within three-four minutes and was never able to complete the download."
Negetive,This is  iPhone is  supposed to be renewed so I don't understand what is the concept of this company when they call it renewed
Positive,It arrived promptly and in great condition. Looks new.
Positive,Para el precio que pague es un muy buen equipo muy satisfecho x my compra
Positive,I had no problems activating it. Works great. Like new condition
Positive,"Great cameras, probably the only reason I bought it. Love the image stability when taking videos."
Positive,Lo ame
Negetive,Phone showed up as stolen so I couldn't get it activated.
Positive,Love it ! It’s actually unlocked very legit !
Positive,I was expecting the best and the worst and I got the best so I didn’t have to return it thank god!
Positive,Like new!
Positive,perfect phone. came in quick and easy.
Positive,iPhone fue recibido con 99% de capacidad máxima de batería. Llegó desbloqueado y fue fácil de activar con mi proveedor de telefonía.
Negetive,"I was not expecting to see multiple deep scratches on the screen, considering the product description said that the quality was excellent. I would have been ok if the scratches were on the body, but not on the screen. Initiated the return on the same day I recd. the phone but no response from the seller and the return has ‘not been approved’ even after 4 days. Not buying Amazon renewed products ever again and definitely not from this seller."
Positive,Works and looks like new!
Positive,I am not sure why would someone wana pay a 1000 when they can buy it for so much less here.
Negetive,Quality is very very bad. I’ve bought refurbished phones before but this seller is not good. Bought a refurbished (excellent) condition phone but basically got a used phone. It was dirty and had multiple deep scratches on it. I can tell they just sell used phones as “refurbished”.
Negetive,Just opened today. Had a couple scratches and dings on side but nothing too serious. Battery life was 89%. Wouldn’t exactly consider it excellent but I was going to just keep it. Went through activation and transfer process and went to make first call and person said it sounded like I was under water. Made another call and same thing. Huge waste of time now that I have to wait to send it back and won’t recieve refund until it’s received so without a phone for an extended period of time if I don’t want additional funds tied up. Don’t waste your time
Positive,"never had any serious issues with any refurbished phones from Amazon, and even when there are they’re always quick to respond and replace them."
Positive,My son dropped his phone in a lake so we needed a replacement. This is in excellent condition and easy to get set up with our carrier.
Positive,no scratches and everything works great. the battery life is 100% and all new
Negetive,I ordered the premium is supposed to have no dents and scratches. The one I received has dents and scratches.But it does have 100% battery capacity.
Positive,"Very fast shipment, device was in excellent condition with battery capacity of 100%"
Positive,Todo bien
Positive,"I was hesitant on buying an iPhone that wasn’t directly from apple but let me tell you I’m so happy I did! This phone works great! No problems, no scratches, clear screen, great camera, great battery life. Next time I need another iPhone I will def be looking here first!"
Positive,"Shipping was very quick, however the phone had some scratches on the screen when it arrived. I suppose thats what you get for buying renewed"
Positive,THIS IS THE SECOND CELL PHONE I HAVE BOUGHT HERE AND THEY HAVE BEEN THE BEST EXPERIENCES.  BOTH HAVE BEEN GOOD VALUE AND HAD GOOD BATTERY LIFE
Positive,"Perfect purchasing experience. I am thankful I was able to reduce waist by using a renewed device. I was understandably nervous of the quality of the device but it was perfect. Aside from the fact that it didn’t come in the typical iPhone box, you can’t tell that it didn’t come straight from the Apple Store. Would definitely buy again!"
Positive,I love my new phone came as described works great no complain I love the color face recognition works finger print and let’s not talk about the battery life like where have this phone been all my life lol I be on my phone a lot so not having to constantly charge it is a plus you got my vote
Positive,Works like new
Negetive,Product is defective returning.
Negetive,Cellphone in bad conditions and wasn't write on description
Negetive,This phone is locked!!  I can not use it on any carrier.  I spent almost 500 for a worthless piece of junk!!!  Do not buy
Negetive,No cumple con lo especificado
Negetive,THey sold me a faulty phone with a face that cracks without dropping it. WARNING THEY ARE NOT WITH AMAZON THEY ARE THRID PARTY COMPANY ACTING AS IF.
Negetive,Solo me duró unos días y fallo la tarjeta interna ??
Positive,El teléfono está en las mejores condiciones posibles viene con un cargador de buena calidad. Muy buena opción
Neutral,"Fast transaction,phone as described.There was missing charger and the cable is not compatible . Therefore I consider my order incomplete."
Positive,It work great
Positive,"Arrived as a brand new phone. No scratches or marks anywhere, and the phone had 100% battery health."
Positive,This isn’t a reflection of the seller but definitely needs to be known. This phone would not activate under a current straight talk plan. I argued with customer service for 2 days. They’d say it was active but wasn’t. I don’t think they’re familiar with the esim process. I was able to activate it on Verizon prepaid. They were very knowledgeable of the process and took great care of me.
Positive,"I was hesitant about spending so much, but I love this phone. It is unlocked and was easy to use. Upgraded from iPhone 8.  A friend bought the same phone and was supposed to be unlocked and he. Was not able to use it. Had to send back. Was not unlocked. So it’s a hit and miss."
Positive,These phones were BotH cosmetically Flawless! Came w/screen protector AND a c type charging block with new lightning charging cable! The phone was fully charged and ready to use! I am very impressed with these phones! They’re perfect
Negetive,"i understand these things happen with refurbished phones, but this camera scratch is incredibly noticeable and is definitely not in ""excellent"" condition. waiting two weeks for it to arrive, sad I need to wait longer to get a new device."
Negetive,Phone came. Worked for about 40 days. Suddenly it was reported stolen and never worked again. Amazon would not honor a return and I sent it back and got $51 for an iPhone 14. Can not get any help with this at all and it’s a total loss of over $700
Negetive,We tried to get straight talk to activate the iPhone 14 and for three days it wouldn’t work so we sending the phone back .
Positive,Just what I wanted for protection for my new phone plus my favorite color too!!!!!
Positive,"So, I bought this because Androids are now the same price as iPhones. So, I decided I was just going to try out iPhones because I've never had one. Buying it on Amazon was way cheaper than buying it in a store or on the apple website. I was a little hesitant because I've bought phones off of Amazon but they've always been Androids and I was worried this this one really wouldn't come unlocked. Thankfully, it was it was extremely easy to set up. I literally just bought mint mobile and then now I have a working cell phone. So, if you are a little hesitant I do think that this is a great purchase. It does not come in a traditional iPhone box. Which doesn't matter to me but it did come with all the parts"
Positive,"I found a scratch on the screen in time, and responded to the business with a refund of part of the money, and the service was very good. In addition, the battery capacity shows 100 percent, but actually feel not very resistant."
Positive,"Me la pase viendo opiniones para ver si me animaba pero la verdad pense que era mentira que no llegaban bien, llego en exelente condición solo unos detalles mínimos y bateria al 100% y sin piezas reperadas me llego ayer espero siga asi y que a futuro no tenga problemas pero lo dudo listo para otra compra a futuro"
Positive,"Buen equipo, llego prácticamente impecable le hice pruebas y todo funciona muy bien, los microfonos, bocinas, camaras y la condición de la batería llegó con un 100% que es mas de lo que esperaba, solo con un golpe en el lateral que solo se ve si ya sabes dónde está, porque pasa desapercibido, la pantalla sin un rayón al igual que la parte trasera."
Positive,"Recibí el producto en perfecto estado (sabiendo que es reacondicionado), con batería al 100% y casi nada de detalles esteticos"
Negetive,SONT NOT BUY THIS PHONE I HAVE HAD It for fours months its overheating company REFUSES TO SEND ANOTHER DO NOT BUY HERE YOU ARE WASTING YOUR MONEY!
Negetive,"It arrived two days early and it's in great condition but it's actually the iphone 14 Plus, not the regular iphone 14. Nowhere on the packaging or on this listing does it say that it's the Plus. Only when it's arrived and you go to the settings does it say iphone 14 Plus."
Positive,Genial 10/10
Positive,"El teléfono muy bien!No llega en caja original pero si trae cable de carga..El mío vino con un pequeño rayón en el cristal de la pantalla casi imperceptible pero nada que afecte el funcionamiento.. también traía la mica de cristal.. batería al 100, las cámaras impecables.. Es ESIM."
Positive,"A pesar de ser reacondicionado no se nota , no tiene rasguño alguno , la batería esta al 100% , venía con un cargador genérico y la pantalla ya venía con una mica de buena calidad , realmente estoy muy satisfecho con la compra , funciona perfectamente, NO tiene ranura para chip físico , yo tengo plan de datos por lo que no tuve problema en usar e-sim"
Positive,"La verdad no confiaba mucho en comprar un equipo así, sin embargo lo recomiendo mucho, llega intacto…como nuevo y la batería al 99%Llegó en caja y cargador genéricoSe tuvo que activar una eSIM sin embargo esto fue rápido"
Positive,Llego muy rápido esperaba más del teléfono ya que en la descripción dice estado excelentePero el teléfono tiene algunos detalles estéticos unos golpes en las esquinas y Los Marcos de las cámaras y unas pequeños rayones en la pantallaY 96% de  pilaY en mi caso me llego para utilizarse con esimEspero todo bien con el paso del tiempo y no falle
Positive,Muy buen producto me llegó con el 90 de pila sin duda compraría otro
Positive,"El artículo llegó en excelente estado, prácticamente nuevo"
Positive,"Also comes with a charger, but the phone case was bought separately."
Positive,every thing was great !
Negetive,Cel phone look great. No scratches nor dents. Had to return cuz hubby went and got one same day. Lol Still waiting for my refund I hope they're not a hassle to return my money!!!! I keep ya posted
Negetive,"I bought two phones and after 8 months, one of my phone is locked out because it is reported as a stole. I want a refund."
Positive,"Phone came in a wonderful condition, battery health is good and everything is working properly, it’s a great buy and I recommend it"
Positive,Feliz con mi iPhone es igual a comprar uno en la tienda de Apple.
Positive,This was a gift for my husband. So far he really likes the phone every thing works great.  Happy I picked this one.
Negetive,After 2 weeks the IPONE wasn’t working anymore. UPS was supposed to show up but didn’t come. The UPS „support“ was NOT available. Only a computer voice which wasn‘t helpful at all. Now I have to to take care of it by myself.
Negetive,"I got the phone 3 days ago. At first, the phone seemed to be of good quality and I was able to configure it without any problems. I noticed that the battery went down quite fast, but I did not think much of it. Yesterday, the phone data stopped working all of a sudden. Hopefully, it worked again after restarting the phone. Today, even though the phone was at 50% battery, it turned off by itself and I cannot turn it on again. The phone won't even charge anymore and is not responding!Now I would like to get a refund. I should erase my iPhone data from the phone, but for this I need it to be turned on... By far my worst experience in Amazon. I will never buy a ""refurbished"" phone ever again"
Negetive,“Temperature iPhone needs to cool down before you can use it.“ Keeps popping up and phone is not hot but cool
Negetive,Phone is great and clean but the battery drains faster than I expected even though the battery health shows 100. It is very disappointing because I hate worrying that my phone will be off or that I have to charge it every often.
Negetive,"I got it yesterday, and requested a refund immediately, as you can see in the pictures screen is not working, Amazon approved my return I’m waiting on the seller to send me the label"
Negetive,Phone was not unlocked like stated. Was said to be a generic iPhone. Wouldn’t work with my carrier service. Had to send it back.
Positive,Appearance Quality
Negetive,"I’ve had this phone for about 2 months and it has been getting worse since I’ve got it. My camera app is completely glitched and won’t let me take any photos, it randomly cuts my sound off, it doesn’t tell me when I get text messages, and it randomly powers off for no reason. I’ve never had a phone be this difficult, I hope they fix it idk it might just be a bug but it is the most frustrating experience for meedit: these phones are horrible, actually the worst phones I’ve ever had. if you wanna buy an iPhone buy models 12 and below cause the new ones are horrendous"
Positive,After reading a review that it wasn’t an unlocked phone and not to buy I freaked ! Once mine came in I was able to set it up with no issues at all in less than 20 minutes. Definitely worth it !
Positive,"I've been using my phone for 5 days and 0 problems, all works perfectly, and it looks like a brand new"
Positive,"Llego en perfectas condiciones sin ningún rasguño, buen empacado y funcionando bien, lo que me gusto fue su memoria de 256gb . Estupendo!"
Positive,"I love it!!! It’s like new, everything works in perfection. Without scratchesI recomended"
Positive,Phone showed up like new. The transfer from the old SIM phone was seamless. Love the new phone. No problems to report.
Positive,"The phone arrived promptly, looks like new. Came with a charger as well. I am super happy with this purchase"
Negetive,"Llegó tarde, rayado y con la batería mala, deberían poner fotos reales de los teléfonos disponibles para no caer en este engaño…"
Negetive,"This phone came with a defect with the camera. Apple identified the camera as unknown, they were scratches too. I thought I could go ahead to use the phone considering the price, suddenly the camera stops working. I send the phone back to the seller, hoping for a refund.Sadly, I am being refunded part payment with a restocking fee deduction for an item I did not damage. I am being refunded not up to half of what I originally paid for. I would not recommend the seller to anyone. Buyers beware!"
Negetive,"Battery health is subpar (88%) and multiple scratches on an Iphone this seller rated as being in ""excellent"" condition. Communication was not good on the sellers end and would not answer my question as to the condition of the battery prior to shipping. When you buy an Iphone on Amazon you take a risk. I should have known this was a mistake to buy something like this on Amazon."
Positive,A+
Positive,Excelente
Negetive,"The phone arrived timely, but continually and spontaneously turns off!  Battery feels hot to the touch. Product will be going back tomorrow! I have a very disappointed child, as this was his main gift, and it is not working correctly."
Negetive,You will not be able to activate any carriers on this phone. I’ve spent hours trying to get it to transfer my Esim and it would not let for any reason; even after I took it to my carrier store or to a tech support. They said that the phone is locked and no carriers will be accepted.
Negetive,"I called apple, Amazon, the company that sold the phone, my service provider, and NO ONE could get the phone ""unlocked"" will not waste my time again, a total of about 1 week, buying a refurbish from this company"
Neutral,"I ordered purple iPhone 14. I got a white iPhone 14. It is in perfect condition so far. The battery was only at 65%, but seems to be ok this phone is LOCKED I called my provider know one knows much about the eSIM. Overall I do wish I would have looked at the overall review most of these phone seem to be locked. The phone looks brand new. You are taking a gamble. If I could activate the phone I wouldn’t care that it’s white. They took the time to clean everything. I have not seen any scratch or sent everything else works great other then I can’t call anyone I can sign into iCloud that’s it this can not be activated and it’s Saturday so can’t talk to anyone. GOOD LUCK to ALL I think I would rather stick with the old school SIM card."
Positive,So to start off with my phone did come a day early. I like the fact that I had to sign for my package making sure that it was a secure delivery. Set up was a little bit difficult but overall easy. I will know that if you are switching to a physical Sim card to an Esims cards you will have to call your provider or go to the store to get that situated. Other than that there were no scratches or any other issues uploading information.
Neutral,"The phone works great, but I was disappointed when opening the box because I did not receive the charger block that plugs into the wall. Previously, I ordered another phone for my husband and he did receive the charger block. However, mines did not come with one. I would like to request that I receive the charger block that plugs into the outlet."
Negetive,Beautiful phone but unable to activate. Verizon said the phone was flagged in their system for account non-payment. They will never activate it until the prior account holder pays the balance. Amazon renewed program and seller never should have resold the phone. I’m livid.
Negetive,Bought the iPhone 14 for Verizon. Went to set it up with Verizon with the IMEI and it says the device is locked and to contact the previous carrier. So basically a dud of a phone. Returning it and disappointed.
Positive,Still had the celephane on front of phone.  Contacted Apple to copy old phone over.  The rep said it qualified for Apple if I choose to do so.  I elected to get the Apple Care for $ 149 for 2 yrs. of warranty.  I figure someone bought this phone and changed their mind.
Positive,No problems
Positive,Bought this Renewed IPhone to replace my older IPhone.  Works like new and battery life is much improved.  Happy with purchase!
Positive,It arrived in perfect condition. I am happy with the purchase.
Neutral,The back camera and flashlight didn’t even work and the battery health is at 89
Neutral,"This iPhone doesn’t the SIM slot and the seller advertises on the page as it does. Luckily my carrier has the eSIM technology, otherwise it would have been a waste of money!"
Positive,"The phone was almost perfect, no scratches, and the touch screen was pretty good as well the battery life"
Positive,Great condition.Just a few scratches on the edges and the speaker is low when it rings.Battery life is 90%FULLY UNLOCKED as stated.Very nice overall. Pleased with the purchase.
Positive,Wasn't sure what condition my refurbished iPhone 14 would arrive it.  It looked brand new except the max battery was only 90%.  They guaranteed 80% or above.  Transfering data was good.  I had to visit Xfinity to activate the phone.  None of my passwords seemed to have been transferred from my old iPhone.The only remaining issue is getting the phone connected to my car to charge.  The car may not put out enough power.
Positive,I really like my i14 I use it all the time.It is user friendly and reliable.Thankyou
Positive,Phone showed up in good condition no scratches or blemishes have not had any issues yet .
Positive,"They made a believer out of me. I thought there’s no way and I spend the money and honest to God, y’all… im writing this review on the phone, its been months… she holds a charge so well and i will forever buy phones from amazon. This is so so so worth it. I transferred everything from my actual SIM card to my eSIM by myself and I’m not tech savvy, it’s so easy. So so so easy. Do yourself a favor and save your damn money and buy this phone"
Positive,IT LOOKS AND FEELS AUTHENTICO!  ITS GOOD TO BUY
Negetive,The speakers are full of what looks like food of some sort cannot hear the noise is very quiet on phone not worth 500$
Positive,My cut on/off button does not work as it did on 03/06/2024
Positive,Perfect condition! I’ll never pay full price for a phone again
Negetive,"Spent several hours dealing with this on a $600 iPhone trying to get unlocked by Verizon. Also, a couple trips to the carrier store. It was a gift for my wife. Apparently the seller doesn’t check status of refurbished phones they sell. This one had a unpaid balance so the carrier locks it. And I wouldn’t have left a bad review in the first place if the seller would respond to (2) voicemails and an email. Sent back 12/28 and still no refund or communication 1/3/24. Buyer beware."
Positive,A nice phone. No dent or any mark with it. 100% battery health.
Positive,"Keep in mind that this is my first time buying a refurbished or ""renewed"" item ever. As such, I wanted to buy the a phone in the best condition possible, because buying refurbished for me is more about morality than price. I just also want my phone to look nice.The phone was clear of scratches on the actual screen, but the outer shell had scrapes along the bottom and sides. There also seemed to be a scratch or scrape around the camera, but everything appeared to be in working order. The battery was 100% so I can't complain about that. For me, I just felt if I was paying so much money I want the product to look the best it can on the exterior as well. The return was easy. The seller does NOT do exchanges. They were very professional. If you don't mind a few scratches for the price, then I think you'll be satisfied. Might not be for me, but it is for somebody."
Negetive,"Do NOT purchase from this seller.  Falsely advertising as Apple products but they are not. I paid over 400$ for a phone that worked less than 6 months.  Battery will not charge at all and phone will not power on.  Took it to the local Apple Store yesterday and they informed me that it is not an Apple product and they will nit repair it or replace battery, even if I paid them for it.  No Apple certified repair place will touch it because it is not an Apple product.  CONSUMER BEWAIRE.  Falsely advertised and huge waste of money.  Will be opening fraud case if not resolved."
Positive,"Great looking iPhone 14, it also shipped really fast can’t thank  everyone enough that was involved getting that phone shipped,  worked out great"
Positive,The phone looked and worked like brand new. Happy with my purchase!
Negetive,"I bought this iPhone to be used with AT&T but it is locked as Verizon only. I tried to contact the seller to get an exchange but they will not allow that despite the same item being listed for sell, although at a higher price now. I would not recommend buying from this seller."
Negetive,"I got this phone expecting no problems due to it's high reviews. After I set it up, I got a text saying it was on a payment plan and was shutting off. Although it didn't shut off, I bought the phone in full and the previous phone had no payment plan. This was very upsetting and disappointing from this company."
Negetive,"Phone looked great and worked at first. But after 1 month my carrier locked it for being stolen. The error was corrected, but continued to happen each month. I’m now returning the phone. I’m very disappointed.*Update: I returned the phone in the original package. The seller claims I did not return the correct phone and I will not receive a refund."
Negetive,"Phone arrived today, in great condition. Contacted AT&T cause I was having issues transferring data to the new phone only to find out phone is locked due to being stolen."
Negetive,"After many attempts to connect this phone when it arrived, I got an email from ATT saying they have blocked my new phone for attempting to connect a stolen device!  They also blocked all of my internet to all of my devices!  I was able to return it for a refund. Sure hope they haven’t tried to resell it!!"
Positive,"First I ran over, then buried, my old iPhone 13 with my backhoe tractor while removing a stump about 5 feet deep.  My wife had to call my old phone and make it ring until I could unbury it and find it. When I did, it was basically shattered with the front and back glass shattered. TO repair it (replace the glass by ubreakifix or iPhone doctors, it was going to cost me about $600.  So, I took a chance and decided to buy this online through amazon. IT IS PEFECT!  No defects, no issues, no problems and I have had it for about 3 months now.  Easy transfer from my old phone to this, everything sinked up, easy peasy!  If you're looking for a phone, for half the price, this is it!"
Positive,Just got the phone today no scuffs or scratches like some of the other reviews everything looks exceptional but unfortunately the battery health is only at 89% which was my biggest fear buying renewed of course that isn’t terrible just not what was expected when buying a re-NEWED phone all in all it works great we will see what the next few months will be like performance wise
Positive,"The phone was nearly in mint condition unlocked as stated in description with a clean serial number (no carrier payment delinquency  lock,reported stolen, etc.) battery health in the mid 90’s. Only issue was it had a noticeable chip in the bezel. I did not return it however because outside of that there was no damage no scratches elsewhere on the phone’s body or screen and I didn’t want to deal with the return process when I knew it was never gonna be visible in a case anyways. Overall satisfied with the phone I got even if it wasn’t perfect."
Positive,"This iPhone 14 has been great! upon getting the phone, I noticed that you could not tell that it was renewed, looks great, runs just like a new phone, and does exactly what I need it to do. A bonus of the phone is so much cheaper buying renewed vs. brand new,"
Positive,I buy excellent quality but it comes with scratches in the screen. Besides those imperfection I love it!! My friends also buy iPhone on Amazon and they were great!! I wasn't that lucky
Positive,Phone was perfect and arrived very quickly. Was just as described.
Positive,Bought this after my daughter dropped her phone in the lake.  It was priced reasonable and arrived looking brand new.  Everything functions as it should.
Positive,"Refurbished, but looked new. Works as it should."
Positive,El producto llegó en buen estado y llevo más de un mes usando y va muy bien. Funciona perfecto. Satisfecho
Positive,Didn’t come with an instruction booklet. Thank God for Google
Positive,"The refurbished phone I bought had a defect with the camera, but they issued me a full refund the next day. No issues with the company. They seem like they really care about customer service."
Positive,What can I say straight talk the best iPhone that asked
Neutral,The phone was in excellent cosmetic condition however the battery died every day by about 4pm. This was the same thing that happened to my old phone (XR) and the reason I got a new one!
Positive,Love my new iPhone
Positive,In good working order!
Positive,My daughter love it.
Positive,We have used this phone for some time now and it seems just as good a new! The battery was really good too.
Positive,Like new great quality no issues with it
Negetive,"I have returned this device over 2 weeks ago and still no refund. The phone looked great put it would randomly power cycle itself while using or even when not being used. I returned phone via UPS store but the return status is still pending as if they didn’t get my return! Beware of this seller, not had this kind of problem on Amazon will be following up with customer service"
Negetive,I tried to activate this refurbished unlocked phone and was told by Apple customer service that it is app locked by Find my Phone.  The previous owner would need to sign out of that account. It is useless to anyone else.
Negetive,When received the phone had not been factory reset and when I tried to all it to my cell service I was told that the phone had been reported lost or stolen.  Confirmed on several websites that track by IMEI number. Cannot add cell service since it is blacklisted.
Negetive,"what a joke, I took the phone to AT&T to have them activated it.  They said it was locked because it was reported stolen and nothing I could do.  I requested a refund and dropped off at UPS store over a week ago.  I still have not been credited.  Now I'm out hundreds of dollars."
Negetive,"When I tried to set up the iPhone 14, it was not unlocked even though it said it was so I had to return it and buy a brand new one from my carrier! It was very inconvenient and now I’m waiting for my refund"
Negetive,This product is a total scam. The phones are locked no matter which you buy. The one I just bought my son proved to be locked too!
Negetive,I just called ATT to activate and this IMEI is reported stolen. Be warned.
Negetive,Do not buy from this seller.I bought a phone that was blocked because it has payment left on it. Nightmare experience for me since I traveled with the phone.
Negetive,The Cellular Resource sold a phone that was carrier-locked due to an unpaid bill by the previous owner! They profit from your returns. Just look at these sweetheart terms from The Cellular Resource: 'Devices received with personal account locks will be refunded 50% of their initial sale price.' The Cellular Resource should be kicked off Amazon for selling defective products.
Negetive,went to activate phone and it was reported stolen so had to return and get my money back...
Negetive,Phone looked great and appeared to work up until I tried to have it activated on my account. AT&T rep stated the phone was locked and had been reported as stolen. I am not saying this was the vendors fault but deep leave me with a delay to resolve.
Negetive,The phone I got was still linked to someone's att account so it may have been able to activate but if the person stopped paying on it I would be stuck with a blacklisted phone outside of the return window. Also got this as a christmas present and didn't have time to order another so had to go to the apple store and pay full price.
Positive,"I bought the excellent condition iPhone 14, received one in exactly being excellent. No scratches, and what surprises me is the battery health 100% and after digging deeper, battery cycle is just 14.This is the 3rd Amazon renewed iPhone I bought in my family. Feel a peace of mind with the 90 day return guarantee!"
Negetive,Camera is not working. The back screen is black. I change it to .5 and I finally see an image to take a photo. I take the picture and it has a ring on the side as if I’m also capturing the camera lens.
Negetive,"The phone is definitely not Excellent condition as described. Had stretches visible seemed like the phone was not used with a protective case at all. Second of all, the camera must of been changed because it was evident by stretches around it. And when taking a video there was evident loud background noise.  Glad I caught that because I almost decided to keep the phone.I was able to return it without issues for full refund.  Added 100$ more n got myself brand new from apple w/o taking any further risks. TY"
Positive,"Vendedor muy atento, me llegó directo a mi casa, todo bien con el software del equipo."
Positive,Todo excelente!!
Positive,Looks like brand new. Was still in original package with seals.  Battery life 100%.
Negetive,"I purchase this mobile on May 2022 and it is working till August then it shows SOS mode and the carrier says IMEI is blocked due to some reason…and I tried to solve the issue but the seller doesn’t respond me for refunding and I want my money back with these item and If there is any response for refunding these item, I am ready to return this item..thanks!!"
Negetive,returned over a month ago and still no refund FYI
Negetive,This phone is locked cannot be activated
Negetive,"So it’s my first iPhone and I always thought iPhones are just way superior to android phones.Turns out that the phone is overall pretty bad. Especially iOS is lacking some fundamental functions that you would take for granted like a “back” button for example. Another example: when Apple is so superior why do I have to stay with the default icons on my screen. I can’t even change the theme of my phone without paying. Well I can at least change the order of my icons on the screen as I like, right? No you can’t. When I am on my iPhone and I want to know the date I have to pull down a whole ass screen to see it. Who needs to know what day it is anyways, people who like Apple obviously not. For every setting I need to go on my home screen and tab the settings icon. When I hear loud music the phone is annoying me with warnings that the music is too loud that you can’t turn off.I wanted to give it back but I waited to long. This is by far my least favorite but also my most expensive phone I ever had."
Positive,I am happy with this iphone
Negetive,Has a visible dent.
Neutral,"I dislike that i paid extra for excellent condition, but have multiple noticeable scratches that i would have assumed this was “good” condition at best. If i had known this was the condition “excellent” would come as i wouldn’t have paid the extra money for it. Otherwise, i am satisfied but we will see as the days go on. Would have rated 5 stars had the screen been in better condition as i paid for."
Positive,good used iPhone but not good price!
Positive,the phone came in 96 percent and it came with no scratch or anything. The only thing that was missing was the shipping that was delayed and was having trouble with Amazon delivering it to me. Other then that it’s great.
Positive,"I bought an iPhone 14 in excellent condition and there is no sign of wear or scratches. It is in mint condition. The battery health is still at 100% too. Also, I bought this one is unlocked and I was able to take it in to the Apple Store to transfer the data from my old 7 to the 14 and the service and phone number transferred. So easy and I didn’t even have to go into AT&T. It also was delivered two days earlier than expected."
Positive,good phone good quality fast shipping no scratches no dings
Negetive,"I am very  dissapointed with this purchase. I purchased this phone on July 17, 2024 and received July 19, 2024. A day after, I realized that the camera isn't working. I contacted Apple customer service. After running a diagnostic test they informed me that the camera in the device was changed and replaced with a non-genuine Apple camera. After reporting this to Amazon, I was told that it could take up to 30 business days for my money to be returned, after returning the device. Now, I bought this phone because I need a phone to use NOW, but because of this deception, I have to do without my phone for however long this will take. I do NOT recommend buying this phone. This is a nightmare! I need my money back NOW!!!"
Negetive,I’m always buy renewed phones and this is the first time that i got the phone like this
Positive,Very good product it’s says renewed but this is like a brand new cell phone and I love it. Keep giving the good service and products!
Positive,"Two little tiny scuffs marks on the edge of the phone that you literally could not see unless you were looking for it, battery life is at 99%. It looks and works great."
Positive,"Al principio dude en hacer la compra y me sentía muy nervioso ya que es la primera vez que compró un teléfono renovado y no sabía en qué condiciones llegaría el teléfono pero me decidí y realicé la compra, la verdad es que estoy totalmente satisfecho con la compra  ya que el teléfono viene como nuevo y condiciones de batería al 100%. La verdad es que volvería a comprar otro igual. También me gustó que viene con protector de pantalla, viene con un cargador generico y un cable pero se agradece."
Positive,"I LOVE IT SM EXACTLY LIKS U THINK IT IS I recommend getting it,it has physical sim,which means it dosent have any hole to put the sim card in it I’ll still work u js gotta put ur info in BUT SO FAR SO GOOD 10/10"
Positive,"Bought this iPhone because I wanted to get away from Android without spending a ton of money on a brand new iPhone 15. Not only is the 14 fast and sleek, but the phone came looking almost perfect! There are some faint scratches on the screen, but other than that, the battery health is 100% and it came with a standard apple charging cord in the box! I am buying all iPhones from this company going forward!"
Neutral,Love the phone but again they sent me the wrong color. I wanted purple they sent me white yeah
Positive,Looked like new.
Neutral,I rated it 3 stars because the battery health was at 90 there’s a few scratches on the the side of the phone. Packing was awful it came in a small box with bubble wrap around the phone. Other than that the phone works great it just heats up a every now and than.
Positive,"Iphone 14 has came in like a new condition! Just with two depressions , like a new with 100% battery life. All recommendations for this seller!"
Positive,Llegó en perfectas condiciones con la batería al 100%
Positive,The phone is really nice! The camera is really clear! Love this phone definitely recommend.
Positive,I was on the fence about buying a refurbished iPhone. I read the reviews and knew for the most part everyone was satisfied with theirs but I was still skeptical. After a heated exchange with my carrier over the cost of a new phone to a current customer I decided to give it a try. When I opened the box I did a detailed inspection and all I found was a slight scratch on the screen off to the side. It doesn’t interfere with anything and is only noticeable when the Lock Screen is off. The battery life is 100% and the camera works with no issues and everything else is like I just bought it new from Apple. Amazon rated this in excellent condition and I agree.
Positive,"I purchased the purple iPhone 14 unlocked but It did not come with the carrier unlocked like it was supposed to but I was able to unlock it with the help of Apple Support, they had me plug the iPhone into into my computer and restore it via the iTunes app. Before I called apple I first contacted the seller and all they did was offer me a refund but I knew I wasn't going to find an iPhone 14 at this price plus the phone came in great condition no damage at all there was a lil tiny tiny scratch on the apple symbol behind the phone but it is not that noticeable at all unless you really look and everything seems to be functioning as normal."
Positive,"El producto llegó en excelente estado, cumple con las expectativas"
Positive,Muy bueno y muy bonito
Positive,"Bought this for my daughter birthday as an upgrade from iphone 11. She loved it, was practically brand new."
Positive,Excelente
Positive,I purchased this phone after switching to spectrum mobile this phone is great and affordable. I’ve had no issues at all. Highly recommend.
Positive,"I bought the refurbished phone in excellent condition, and it worked and appeared as if brand new. Have had it for a few weeks now and it still works perfectly! Would highly recommend to someone looking for a less pricey option"
Positive,It’s basically in excellent condition and the battery health is 100%
Positive,"Se ve en perfectas condiciones, realmente comprar un refurbished es lo mejor ya que te ahorras dinero y funcionan super bien."
Positive,Work well & no problem now
Positive,Good battery life and quick charge
Neutral,"The phone was delivered 3 days earlier than speculated which I thought was grand. Although, it mentioned it was good condition, it was pretty scratched on the screen, and edges. The crevices were also pretty dirty around the camera and phone edges."
Positive,"I was sooooo worried going off the reviews. People saying it’s not really unlocked and had to return it bc they couldn’t hook it to their cell network. But when I got it I was able to connect everything working 15 mins! Theres a scratch on the back where the apple is, and another on the front right corner but they’re very minor and can barely notice them. This is my dream phone and there’s no way I could afford it from Apple so I’m so glad that Amazon has these  phones at such good price and condition. Y'all seriously made my dreams come true. I’m sorry if other people has had bad experiences but mine has been a 10/10 would recommend this phone. If I end up having issues down the road I’ll edit this but no complaints at all! ??"
Positive,Be prepared to talk to your cellular network people to set up sim chip if you don’t have your old phone still. Phone is amazing above the best quality I would think it was brand new. Just Apple making the 14 and no sim reader was difficult to set up cellular network has nothing to do with this phone just Apple and my carrier straight talk had no idea how to fix my problem has to talk to the main people. Works great now tho. Charges fast! Love the purple color screen has no marks!
Positive,You can tell that it’s not new
Negetive,"I would say the quality is “good” and not “excellent”. There are multiple defects that are immediately noticeable. Most of the bubbles are from my poor application skills. However, the bubble under the second scratch is a small scratch/crack creating said bubble. Not only is it easy to tell the phone was dropped repeatedly, it wasn’t recognized as an apple product and locked my eSIM. Took about 30 minutes to contact my carrier and get it unlocked. When it locked it also locked me out of my old phone preventing me from making any calls. I couldn’t even contact my carrier, I had to use someone else’s phone. Oh, and I still can’t connect my eSIM to it; I have to go in person for that."
Positive,"Muy buen teléfono, totalmente operativo aquí en Lima Perú"
Neutral,"I have spent hardly a month with this phone and not only did it come with a battery life much lower than promised considering the “excellent condition” advertisement, but I have found scratches on the camera lens, which is much worse than promised. Now, I’ve found it acting up and lagging as if it were an ages old phone.I trusted the positive reviews would be fairly applicable but now that I have the phone, I would not trust and would not recommend buying again."
Positive,The phone was in good condition battery health was 96% percent. Works great!
Neutral,I will have to go to AT&T to see if the freezings of screen can be fixed.  ??
Positive,I was nervous because after I ordered the phone I noticed that the listing said the phone was in “acceptable” condition but I got the phone in the mail today and it is practically perfect! You would never know that it’s a refurbished phone. The battery life is perfect and there are no imperfections on the phone. Very happy with my purchase! Great price and great phone.
Positive,me pareció una excelente opción en caso de no poder comprar un celular nuevo.
Positive,"I was also apprehensive after seeing some reviews that this refurbished iPhone was not unlocked. But I had no trouble whatsoever getting this setup, migrating data from the old phone and getting my carrier & number activated on the new phone was super easy and quick.It should be noted that iPhone 14 does not use removable SIM cards anymore (despite the fact that a SIM tool was included with this). It used an embedded SIM (eSIM) that is not supported by all carriers. All of the major carriers support eSIM (like AT&T, T-Mobil,e Verizon), but some of the smaller ones may not yet support it, so check your carrier to make sure it supports eSIM activation. My carrier (Mint) luckily supported it and took less than 5 minutes to get the phone number migrated and activated."
Negetive,I can’t believe I have to go through this process. I really don’t want to have to send this iphone14 back for a different one (they don’t have in stock) but I can NOT get my screen to not look like busted garbage. I’ve tried every possible setting in the phone to get it to some sort of normal colour temp but it’s always off and ugly and I need this phone for my art work. I can’t use a phone with a busted screen with art and just be okay with it.
Negetive,"Cellphone is as described but the battery life is terrible, not even 2 hours watching videos"
Positive,I purchased this because I’m new to Apple but I don’t want to pay full price on a new one. I got my iPhone within a few days try it out no issues. I added service and had my family member look over to be sure everything was working fine. It’s good and worth it. It’s best purchase I made. I have t-mobile as my cellular service and was easy to set up. No more than 10 minutes and I was out the door.
Positive,Was and still am very happy with this cell phone. Condition was pretty much brand new and was delivered in a timely manner. 5 thumbs up!
Positive,I got it a few days ago and it’s been working perfectly!
Positive,The delivery and the product were according to the specifications. Good traking information
Positive,very good product I am super happy with the purchase
Negetive,All my calls have been getting dropped and I even switched phone service to end up with the same issue. Now I’m buying a brand new phone!  It was the phone I bought the whole time.
Positive,"I have only had it a week or so but I love it. Saved over $900. This is my first iPhone, changing from a Samsung 8, It has made a world of difference to me and my Business."
Positive,This is my first iPhone and I was glad I could get one at a substantial discount. It's in amazing condition and even the guy at the Verizon store was impressed. However it would to have been good to know beforehand a signature was required. I had a real problem with UPS.
Positive,It was above expectations...you could hardly know it was used...has great battery like and connectivity to devices.
Positive,"Me llegó en muy buen estado, sin rayones ni marcas de uso, con el 100% de batería. En lo único que deberían advertir es que no viene con posibilidad de tener sim física"
Positive,"Upgraded my 8 to this renewed 14, and so happy I did!  It looks and acts  brand new!  You don't really need instructions to transfer data, once it's on, the screen tells you what to do, step by step!  I did have to visit the local Verizon and he finished it in no time at all.  So far the battery is great, charged to 100% and stays charged longer."
Positive,A refurbished Iphone 14 but works great!  Great price and fast shipping.  Looks like new.  No problem setting it up and transferring from one phone to the other.  I did have to go to Verizon to complete the setup as the Iphone 14 does not have a sim card.  Not an issue.  Sales person was able to help me quickly.  Love my new phone!
Negetive,"I never write reviews, so please hear me when I say do not buy this phone!!! At first, I thought I got an essentially new phone for a great price. Sometime in the first few months, the screen started glitching like I was pressing on it when I wasn’t. One time, I had it face up on the counter untouched and it started typing letters. Now, at its worst, it’ll work enough for me to unlock my phone, and then the touchscreen won’t work at all. I have to repeatedly turn it on and off, even full on smacking the screen for it to work. I wish I had bought a new Apple phone because this has been a waste of money. Also, it took me a good 2 hours with tech support from Verizon and Apple to get the eSIM to work. Amazon didn’t help at all. Again, PLEASE DON’T BUY THIS PHONE!! It’s not worth the headache to save a couple hundred bucks because anything you “saved” will be used to buy a new phone anyways."
Negetive,"2 stars because the phone worked, but there were scratches on the glass, a permanent white dot inside the screen and a dent/chipped paint on the bottom right corner where the phone had been dropped.  I thought you’re supposed to fix this stuff on refurbs.  I would never purchase from you again.  Don’t contact me."
Positive,This is a beautiful phone and was in the correct condition. I ended up haven’t to return it but the seller was very easy to work with.
Positive,arrived well packaged and wors great
Negetive,couldnt even get it past set up without with freezing over and over again
Positive,"I bought the starlight 128 gb in acceptable condition for $380.76. Considering other reviews, I was worried that the phone would be beat up or have major problems. To my surprise, the phone has not even one scratch or dent. It’s completely perfect! The cameras work well and have great quality, and the charging capacity is at 95%"
Positive,Phone looked in very good condition but The touch screen wasn’t  responsive all the time. Sometimes was hard to make selections and other times making unintended selections when touched.
Positive,"El celular llego en perfectas condiciones, prácticamente nuevo y con la batería nueva. El vendedor fue muy amable y contesto mis constantes mensajes ya que yo necesitaba un invoice donde figurara el IMEI por regulaciones en mi pais. Le doy 5 estrellas y sin dudarlo volvería a comprar."
Positive,Perfect
Positive,"Got it today, delivered 1 day earlier than promised (thank you!). Clean and in great condition. Transfered my info from old phone easily. So far, happy with my purchase."
Positive,"I got the phone 4 days earlier than expected and it came packaged nice and protected. It also came with a charger and instructions for return if needed. It was dead when I received it but once it powered on I was able to set it up. As for as the esim goes everything moved over perfectly , though at first I wasn’t able to switch my number over in the initial set up but after I finished and it opened to home screen it asked again about moving over the number and it did switch over .  Phone is giving me no issues at all. This is a great buy!"
Positive,"I got my phone today and it was super easy to set up. The battery capacity was at 100% and there was no visible damage on the phone at all! If you’re worried about the E-Sim at all like I was, don’t be. It was extremely easy to transfer my sim card and all of my data onto this phone. So far I’ve had absolutely no problems and I highly recommend buying from this company. It came with a charger and a block."
Positive,"It looked like it was a return from China, but not sure. Still a good authentic iPhone."
Positive,"Had it for about a month now. Ordered it in “acceptable” condition, willing to accept some cosmetic damage. Received a perfect phone with no damage whatsoever that works perfectly."
Positive,I’m extremely satisfied with my purchase the phone came on time and it’s in perfect working condition and it has no scratches any where! Thank you to the amazing seller!
Positive,"Wow!  As some have said, this renewed iPhone is like new.  I had my concerns, but the much lower price hooked me.  I received the product in great condition and, importantly, with a 100% battery.  The transfer of data from the old phone (XR) was flawless except for one thing - the eSIM did not transfer. I wasted about an hour trying to figure what I had done wrong, but a quick trip to T-Moble got that done in about 15 minutes.  Flawless operation at a BIG savings.  My concerns were without merit.  Thank you Amazon for offering a great service!  I have only had it in my possession for 24 hours, but, baring a big change in what I am seeing, all is good!"
Positive,Like brand new great deal
Negetive,"The phone I received has green marks on the LCD screen, most likely dead or stuck pixels, as well as the screen gets random ghost touching sometimes and becomes impossible to use for a few seconds. The seller apparently used an unknown display that was not apple certified and this is what happens. My seller was SynergyTM, I will issue a return and try again from another seller and update my review if it turns out better"
Positive,"It’s just a great phone The battery life is great on this phone. You can go all day and not have to charge you so that’s very good. I would take a picture, but I’m on the phone"
Positive,Came looking brand new with 100 percent battery life.  It’s been working great for me and I would buy again from this company.
Negetive,"Item was marked as “excellent” condition, but has a very used battery. Diagnostic test shows the condition is “fair” at best from heavy use."
Positive,The phones are good. The only thing i did not like is that one phone was death and the other was about to die when i got it.But i am they work good.
Positive,Came a day early!! Good condition no complaints!! I love it !! bought this for wifey birthday and she was extremely happy I almost got with ATT thank God I didn't ! Stayed with Metro PCS!!! All Good!!!
Positive,"I am always amazed with Amazon’s Refurbished Products . This phone doesn’t have any scratches , scuffs and looks like it’s never been used. The battery is at 92% and I am really satisfied ."
Positive,"I bought this for my daughter, it came in a good shape no scratches like new condition."
Positive,Escribiendo esta opinión desde el iPhone. un teléfono sinceramente increíble el cual vale completamente la pena su compra renovada. Me llegó con 97% de batería y hasta el momento anda de una manera increíble
Positive,"Never thought but this phone is like almost new. No scratches or nothing, plus Amazon gives good return policy on it and we can buy it stress free"
Negetive,I ordered this for my son and when it came the camera was cracked and it came with no charger I’m very disappointed.
Negetive,"The phone has several light scratches on the screen, though the body is mint. Battery health - 86%. Misrepresented as “Excellent”, would have returned but needed a Father’s Day gift and didn’t have time to shop elsewhere. Do not recommend."
Positive,"I’m very happy with this purchase, saved $200 from going to the T-Mobile store. Looks like brand new and battery at 100%. Easy to set up.  We’ll be doing this again when needed."
Negetive,"I ordered this iPhone 14 under excellent condition category. Paid $469 which seemed like a great deal for a phone labeled excellent condition. It came with a big scratch on the top of the metal frame. Around the edges I can see white residue from the glue used to refurbish a new screen. I tried to wipe it with alcohol, but it does not go away. Very misleading product description. I quickly reported the problem and returned the phone."
Negetive,The phone was suppose to be unlocked to T mobile and when i went to get it activated its was not even unlocked to that carrier… phone was on great condition tho
Negetive,"Bought this to use on T-Mobile's system for my daughter.  When attempting to install eSim, T-Mobile said this phone was locked to another user, and we needed to get permission from that person to unlock it.HUGE waste of time...very disappointed.2 THUMBS DOWN"
Positive,Product was in prestine condition. Almost like new. Reasonable price and delivered on time.
Negetive,"I was originally impressed with this device as it had no blemishes on the outside and the battery health was good, however after an incident where a small amount of water splashed on the phone and got trapped behind the camera I took the phone in to a trusted local shop and we found that the phone wasn’t sealed properly and that the internal charging coil was just free floating inside the phone- obviously this phone wasn’t inspected as well as they claim for an “excellent” condition and Amazon approved refurbished device. I’m super disappointed and had to spend more money just to have a working phone because of shortcuts that would have been cheap and easy to correct before selling a device that is supposed to be ”excellent”."
Positive,The phone was in great condition. It looked pretty much brand new. I was able to connect it to my wireless carrier with no issues.
Positive,"The phone didn’t come in the original box or with the original charger, but that doesn’t matter. The phone came brand new without a single scratch, scuff, not even a minor imperfection. Battery capacity is at 100% and performs as such. I bought this phone for a family member and and purchased a renewed 14 Plus for myself, it came just as perfect as this one. It works and operates as if I bought it brand new, it’s hard to believe this is preowned. I highly recommend this as it’s over $150 cheaper than buying it brand new. It came super fast too!"
Positive,I love it all the features ?? the best money I ever spent on this phone and it’s worth the money too
Neutral,"Great phone, looks perfect. But the camera, when trying to take a tight shot, very close up, does NOT work. And I take lots of macro shots so, I’m not pleased."
Positive,Looked new. Works as if new. No problems at all.
Positive,It met my expectations
Negetive,I bought the cellphone and it came with a hardware problem  in the microwave I couldn’t send audios. I am return the cellphone.
Positive,The phone was shipped almost immediately and got to me two days earlier than expected. The condition of the phone was new and the battery health was at 100%. Have only had it for about a week but haven’t had any issues as of now. Great experience so far!
Positive,I like the size and I will use it myself.
Negetive,I purchased this item as a gift. I took the phone to the at&a store to activate and they informed me the phone was stolen. And it belongs to someone else.
Neutral,"Thought I was getting a renewed or refurbished phone. I have here a used phone that wasn't even cleaned up. It is dented all over the edges, the mic and speaker is clogged with dirt and debris. The screen has some scratches as well, not real bad ones but a few none the less. The up volume button keeps sticking. Obviously whoever owned this phone did not keep it in a case or care much for it. The phone is working fine so far so we will see how long it lasts, I am placing it in an otter box so I suppose I won't see the dents and all but they could have cleaned it up at least...."
Positive,"The product came exactly as described! It had 100% battery health! Came super fast, got it three days before it was suppose to be deliver! Worth the money!!"
Negetive,"Llegó super rápido. Cumple con el envio. La pantalla llego un poco rayada, no afecta el funcionamiento. Pero sugiero en estos casos enviar con la pantalla rayada para las personas que compran en calidad buena o aceptable.No recomiendo comprar en excelente estado, no vale la pena."
Negetive,"I picked the starlight color. There’s a vertical scratch on the front, and the maximum battery life is only 84%. I need to return this."
Negetive,"I honestly wish I read the 1 star reviews instead of the 4 and 5 star reviews. As soon as I started setting up the phone, it kept shutting off and turning back on. I didn’t even have a second to look at the screen properly. This kept going on the whole night and the issue rectified itself the next day so I thought everything was okay. Then the issue has started right back and I’m just so disappointed. I don’t know if it’s an issue with the battery or what but I’m really saddened by this cause I was looking forward to using this phone normally. The phone battery isn’t dead so I’m not sure why it keeps shutting off."
Positive,"Installation was extremely easy, thanks to instruction video (QR code provided in box). The fit is perfect, and will not affect finger print sensor sensitivity nor interfere with protective case. It is extremely transparent, and you can't tell it is on the screen."
Positive,El iPhone llego en tiempo y forma y realmente parece nuevo !La batería al 100% gracias
Negetive,"Said in advertisement that this phone was unlocked for all carriers but upon attempting to add this to my service discovered it was carrier locked and that the carrier would need to be contacted.  No idea how to resolve that and when I reached out for support, they didn't even know that this device was an esim and offered physical sim card trouble shooting.  Was a total fail of an experience."
Negetive,"Be careful, I bought a iPhone 14 from this seller in 2023 worked perfectly for more than a year and today it says SOS, there’s no service. When I called T mobile they said that my phone was reported stolen. Don’t buy phones from this seller!"
Negetive,The iPhone I purchased was a stolen phone.
Positive,Had some scratches
Negetive,"This was a refurb in what was listed and prices ""excellent"" condition. On the outside it did look good. The cable and charger were generic but seemed to work well enough. Starting the transfer process I had to first update the IOS so that was pretty normal. As soon as I upgraded IOS started alerting me that the camera was not identified as apple certified. I power cycled, searched for updates etc but the alert stayed. This was not an insignificant amount of money and it was identified as an apple iphone 14. Nowhere did it state that non apple certified parts were used. I reached out to vendor and if they contact me back and correct the issue I will adjust that part of the rating and update the review but at this point they still have not contacted me. In a couple days without hearing, I will start the refund process and stop payment as it will be very close to a fraudulent sale on their part."
Positive,"I was hesitant, but it’s perfect. Also way cheaper than other retailers and quick delivery."
Positive,My granddaughter needed a new I phone. So I found this one on Amazon and it has been working great. She is happy and so am I.
Positive,The phone was in new condition.
Negetive,I tried three different iPhones because the price is pretty good.  None worked on Verizon because they were locked to a previous (unidentified) carrier.  The third attempt was at a Verizon store and they verified it was locked.  The phones all were in excellent condition they just wouldn't connect.  Fortunately the return process was easy.
Negetive,"I didn't like that I have to return the phone because it was just what I was looking for.  And because it was faulty I ended up having to buy a new model, not refurbished, so that I had  a phone that works with the provider.  It also meant I had to spend more money in addition to the lenghthy time I spent at Verizon trying to solve the problem."
Negetive,Don't buy from this outfit unless you're prepared to waste hours with Verizon tech trying to make a phone that is not activatable under Verizon even when it is sold as a Verizon compatible phone.
Negetive,"I was given the phone as a Christmas gift by my husband. When I had trouble with the setup and took it to the verizon store, I was told this phone was locked by the seller and could not be used. The phone is beautiful."
Negetive,"The phone arrived in 3 days as said, but when I tried to activate, I couldn't because it's locked. I have to contact my carrier but they're closed. I tried contacting seller and haven't heard back.Side note- apparently the newer iPhone doesn't take a SIM card"
Negetive,Phone is locked and my provider cannot transfer my old number.
Positive,I bought the excellent condition phone in starlight when it was like $497. It came in pretty dirty around the camera and the buttons. The battery health was at 87%. Other than that there was not a single sign of damage on the phone. Camera works amazing as ever. When I contacted them about the dirtiness of the phone they were very understanding and actually refunded me $50. I would definitely buy from them again just because of their customer service.
Positive,Good quality
Positive,The screen had a scuff on the top right but it’s hardly noticeable with the privacy screen protector over it I’m very happy and surprised with the quality or the phone I selected the “acceptable” condition option and the phone looks practically new very happy with my purchase definitely willing to purchase another device in the near future
Positive,"Very nice IPhone, I would recommend seller however this particular model's screen size was smaller than I wanted and I returned it for that reason. Am looking for Pro or Plus that has larger screen size."
Positive,"The condition of this phone was advertised as excellent, and it really is like new. I ordered a screen protector for it but realized it already has one! It works perfectly, so I’m very happy with the quality and especially the price. I’d buy a renewed product from this vendor again without hesitation."
Positive,"It came looking brand new with no scratches nor no dents. It came with a fully charged battery. It was also easy to set up but if you don’t have a eSIM with your carrier, you will have to go in and apply for one. Over all I’d recommend purchasing."
Positive,"This phone was worth the price. I ordered a 128GB starlight 14 in excellent condition. It arrived on time. I noticed that it came with a matte screen protector. When I peeled it off I saw a scratch on the screen about 1.5 inches long. It wasn’t deep enough to return the phone but I felt like they were trying to hide it with the screen protector. For a refurbished “excellent” phone I would have expected them to replace the screen. Regardless, I am satisfied overall."
Positive,I love everything about this phone Came with 100% battery health no scratches what so ever I am definitely looking forward to future purchases from this seller. In love
Positive,"Trepidation about ordering a ""renewed"" iPhone phone was totally alleviated! The phone arrived in pristine condition; it looks brand new! Once I began using it, I discovered that the battery was 100%. Every function has worked flawlessly, and the phone charge lasts far longer than expected as well as recharging quickly.This is my first iPhone as i have been an Android user for years. My family has bugged me to convert to Apple, but I have resisted. Now that I have this phone it's obvious my concern was ill-founded.Therefore, trust the Amazon renewal process if my experience is a good reference! Highly recommend!!!"
Positive,Works well.
Positive,Ordered a phone and found out I couldn’t use it on my network. They responded quickly and told me what to do to get it sent back. Got my refund quickly. Highly recommended
Positive,"Came two days early, perfect condition, no complaints.Edit like 5 months later:  it does end up yellowing but tbh most clear cases do that"
Negetive,"The screen has very distinct scratches and the camera lenses on the back are dirty.While I’m fully aware that this is a renewed device, I have not had this problem with refurbished devices before (including and iPhone 8, iPhone Xr, iPad gen 9).  I’m not entirely sure what classifies each device as either Excellent, Good, or Acceptable, but this device was not excellent by any means.  The condition was worse than other devices I’ve purchased in Good quality."
Negetive,"It was in perfect condition externally but when I opened the camera, i noticed the cracks it had even though i chose the EXCELLENT refurnished one. There are also tiny scratches but it’s not noticeable. I would’ve been okay with the scratches but the lens is absolutely horrible and cracked.."
Positive,No issues. Easy esim setup and no scratches or defaults.
Positive,No coment
Positive,Great refurbished!Works like brand new
Negetive,Frond down right corner of frame is cracked
Negetive,"From all the corners, returning it"
Positive,"I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!"
Positive,"I really wanted to get an iPhone and it is my first iPhone but i loved it the sound quality is great and it charges fast, the phone is a bit heavy but it looks classy the display also works well and the camera is the best ????"
Positive,"Things I liked:1. Solid Build Quality and very polished software (compared to Samsung's One UI)2. Camera:-Rear: Rear camera is pretty decent with good color accuracy in all lighting conditions. Videos are steady and smooth.3. Mic / Speakers: Mic is exceptionally well, isolates all background sounds in noisy situations. Speakers are crisp with good bass.4. Performance: This is where the phone shines, you can throw any app available on the App store and it will run it without breaking a sweat.5. Face Id works like charm, it's the best biometric phone lock out there undoubtedly.Things I wish were better:1. Battery life would have been better, I get up to 4.30 - 5 Hours SOT with mixed usage (high brightness, 1 hour calls, 2-3 hour social media, and 2 hour media playback/music)2. Charges Slow compared to my earlier Samsung. Takes almost 1.2 Hours from 20% to 80%3. Front camera is average, it fails to get correct skin tones and lighting. I keep it on default and still it produces over saturated photos.4. Dialer / phone app sucks. I am someone who makes up to 200 calls a day due to nature of my SCM work. Dialer on Samsung is far better. For unknown call you can add a note to the number in Samsung and it reflect when the person call you again, without having to save unnecessary contacts. Number pad does not detect contact unless complete number is typed."
Positive,Each and every thingLove this Product
Positive,I’m using it from almost 2 months there no issue I’m facing as such now …camera quality is great ?? and best part is it’s Display gives you premium experience u can go for it
Positive,"Writing this review after using the phone for 5 months.Pros- camera clicks amazing pictures, video recording is the best I've seen in a phone so far compared to my previous phones. Stable videos with no shaking- battery life is good. Lasts an entire day with medium use. I don't game on the phone. Charging is as quick as it is with phones that use USB C.- display is soo good. So bright- built is solid, dropped phone a couple of times once with the cover and once without and not even a scratch.- listening to music and watching videos is a hot cos of how good the speakers r. Crystal clear with the right amount of bass and treble.Cons- phone is a tad heavy and using it for hrs on a stretch can result in pain in the wrist or fingersGot the phone in Diwali sale on discount so bang for buck if u ask me"
Positive,best phone
Positive,iPhone is best
Positive,Working good
Positive,Nice
Neutral,I thought the mobile would turn out to be very big.  It turned out to be small but the heart did not enjoy it.
Negetive,"If you are an Android user, stick to the best available Android in your budget. This is an over-hyped device which performs poorly on hygiene parameters (for eg. there is no function to go back), has poor precision in touch, limited battery life which dies much before the day ends to name a few. Also, transferring data from Android is an issue."
Negetive,Colour same delivery nahi kiya aur speaker bhi kharab tha chal hi nahi raha tha
Negetive,When I received the phone it felt like the brand new..But when I saw the round spot around the camera lense on 2nd day after delivery. I think that amazon fools customer.
Negetive,Received different specification & defective charging cable..
Negetive,"Don't buy expensive products with Amazon and especially Apple products. Once you buy it, it's left to the mercy of apple and Amazon. Neither of them care."
Negetive,I expected better camera quality at such price. but its bad. Selfie is blurry.
Negetive,Front camera wasn’t working. Got a defective piece.
Neutral,Same as I phone 12 ??. Who so ever is reading this review I suggest go for I phone 12
Negetive,"You will be happy for a good deal but after like a year after the waranty gets over, soon you will get this green screen and not even apple will help you i repeat not even apple!"
Positive,"Every thing is good about iPhones, there's nothing compared to it's speed and ios but i was disappointed because there's no charger for it even though Indian judiciary told them to provide , still they haven't made any progress regarding charger. Why should we spend 62k and more than that for iPhones because of it's brand and Acessories comfort size and Features right if that's not there what's point of buying an iPhone.Thank you??"
Positive,"It look so fabulous, I am android user switched to apple, performance wise iPhone is more better than android due to A15 Bionic chip. I feel pleasant while using iPhone in hand. I like it very much ????"
Positive,"I tried to flip camera while recording but no facility is added here. You have to pause first then you can flip from back to front or vice versa it means you can't continue it, very awkward position. Iphone software should be upgraded so that we can make it go. It's very essential for a content creator. I purchased gimbal dji om se but it could not provided that, it's very essential for a vlogger but I was fed up after finding the basic requirements wasn't built in these products !"

Neutral,"IOS 17.5 (current version updated from 16.6)Thw worst thing as a ios user for me that the fear of update , i heared some updates get display issues battery drain issues , god sake i doesn't had any issues from ios updates , but till i care- device  was great, super handy for me, little feeling of weight .Display - The 60Hz refresh rate didn't felt badly form me cause i am used such kind of device before. - The brightness Range is so comfortable. - The 2160p60 HDR videos in youtube give blissful experianceBattery And charging - The charging time:- i took 1Hour to charge  from 20% to 91% using apple 20w original adapter and cable without any interruption(no electricity break or disconnection ,calls etc) - Battery backup - I am mostly maintain battery in btw 20% <-> 80% so i think this may get one day backup for me ,Average 5h screen on timeThe one day backup is just a advertisemnt advertisement label usaully we use, actually a day like  events,party,outing  we use -camera ,editing app, social media app more than usual use , that day i didn't get a satisfied backup . - Little temperature warming while charging , no heating issue- battery health after 6 month 98%-battery cycle count 194  after 6 monthPerfomance - Good perfomance for video editing ,photography , social media . (I am not a gamer ) Camera-  Even though i  felt some lag or stuck screens in some third party applications - The cinematic Mode is mind Blowing . i missed 13 pro or higher varients for zooming in this mode . - Actually i really miss pro variant for the tele lens and camera features while i using this . Cost is wall for me. - The photos are nice and feature like exposure adjust and filter was good and quality photos . And the 5x zoomed photos is not good for me.it reduced the pixel quality .- The video and optical image stabilisation was mind blowing . i mostly explore on videos . it was soo good , no words other than that.AND THE BIGGEST FEAR FOR ME NOW IS IOS UPDATEi turned off the auto update at first place .i heared about DISPLAY ISSUES,HEATING ISSUES and BUGS in the ios updates for 13 and 14 series.So for expencive and established brand like apple does not fair . This is the only -ve i have to say as a reminder .Also i heared without ios update display issues are happened . Buy the way it is a hardware issue one of the display provider company's batch may show the issues . but we customers cannot identify which company provides the hardaware.I will attach my battery analytics data screnshot photo here so you can better understand how the battery is good The ordering experience in the greate indian sale was worst . I planned to buy this for 45999/- in oct7 greate indian sale offer but i got canceled then i bought for 48999 that was disppointed .As a whole i didn't recommend base models ,i felt i must have buy pro variant but for person who need ios in affordable price i recommend 13 is better than 14"
Neutral,Picture quality is fine but hanging issue
Negetive,First of all they will deliver the mobilelateThey will then show the mobile exchange app the mobile is nt proper even when it's working fine.And have to pay remaining amount.They have sold the mobile..
Neutral,"Those who have been using Android phones may find iOS very limited in features. For example, you will have to pay for the premium plan of Truecaller if you want to monitor real-time calls for spam/block.The dialer app on iOS is a mess. It's tedious to find and locate a contact from within the dialer app.Using Gmail, Google Photos and other Google ecosystem apps that they have been using over years flawlessly is also no so smooth and flawless.Using iOS has come to me as a shocking experience of using my phone with excessive restrictions of the OS.Even the apps on Android OS are more flawless and smooth than on iOS.Last but not the least, if you're using Windows on your PC/laptop, an Android phone compliments more than what an Apple phone does. To this, you can see how seriously Microsoft is developing apps for Android.So, it was a productivity loss to switch from Android to iOS if you're a Windows user."
Negetive,"Things to remember before you buy an Iphone -1) It is good only untill its warranty is there, for extended warranty, it is 10k approx for one year.2) Under warranty also, it's resell value is only 25k in Apple store, so this itself explains that the mobile is over-priced, and that's why resell value under warranty is 25k which is it's actual value.3) Once the warranty expires - Apple will keep on bringing in updated versions and the updated versions will mall function in a 1 year old Iphone as well. Problems include - Green screen, network issues, etc.4) Many people Iphones underwent Green Screen after the latest update and as their Iphone was not under warranty had to spend 400$ or 11k to 15k depending upon their model for screen repair or change. Meaning Apple company will release update, because of which the Iphone will malfunction and people have to spend money inorder to repair it.5) Iphone - covers, tampered glass are all very expensive and are of third class quality and design. Even after spending 1500 to 2000 INR for an Iphone cover, it will last only for 6-8 months. After that, either it will become dull, dirty or look ugly or pale. An android cover of 250 Rs also functions the same way.6) Apps - That is a total scam everyone knows that. You have to pay for many apps and many apps are still unavailable in App StoreMoral of the story -You can buy an expensive Iphone and use it comfortable for a year or maximum 2. So, if you are ready to spend so much money just for a year, it is the best mobile. For long run, this is just a scam that it will last for a long run.Joke of the year - You will be prompted with features that Iphone and Macbook's only have! - The only issue is, comman man never uses those features! So, people inorder to prove that this is a very unique feature, unnecessarily use it, show it and claim that it could be done only because they have an Iphone. Kudos to them for doing something alien!"
Negetive,It was excellent
Neutral,"Dear Sir, The iPhone's battery is totally draining within 4 hours of the full recharge. I am sending your emails(cs-reply@amazon.in) from 21st of June and no reply or action is there except some automated messages saying, "" we have received your email and a customer service associate will be in touch within the next 6 hours"". But till date no one contacted us and we are not able to use this iPhone. Please look into the matter and make the arrangements to replace the iPhone at the earliest. Please help us to give your customer care center in Bangalore, so that we can take the phone to them, show the problem and get the replacement."
Neutral,"After using for almost a month, I don’t feel that this iPhone is worth 64K.EY me brief my review.Pros:Excellent battery life.Nice sound.Nice Back Camera.Video streams smoothly.Cons:1. Doesn’t take good selfies. Literally bad at taking selfies makes you look more ugly.2. Touch is ok ok not as per apple standards but it’s soft.3. Literally hard to transfer data from android to iPhone.4. iCloud storage is only 3 GB after that you need to pay for upgrade, better go for 128GB variant.5. No jack for headphones it is only compatible with Bluetooth headphones, another drawback which I was not aware before buying.6. Most of you would be aware that it doesn’t comes with a charger and you have to buy separately.7. If your hands are wet this phone won’t work. I don’t know if it’s really ip68 waterproof kinda stuff because earlier I had Samsung galaxy S8 and it used to work in water and with wet hands also.Overall, it is highly overpriced as per the features. I haven’t tried it for gaming yet so can’t say anything about it. I would not recommend anyone to buy iPhone due to overpriced if u have extra money to waste then go for it."
Negetive,The microphone does not work at all. Went up to the service center to check that and they are saying it is all ok and suggesting to add the screen guard and remove the back coverDid that as well but nothing is working to solve the issue. Amazon on the other hand is saying that they won’t replace the phone or refund the amountNot at all accepted from a company like Amazon that they do not evaluate the seller and allow them to sell through their platform.
Negetive,I phone ki battery purani h .band ho gi h .mobile ni chal raha h.

Negetive,The phone's video calling is very poor and noisy and call drops in between the conversation. The defect arises later after the return window is closed! Very bad experience ??
Neutral,"Hello guys! I purchased this at best price , when it's delivered there is no issue found in this product. No scratches and no cracks fully new and genuine product given by Amazon!!! When I checked after getting delivery all things are working perfectly fine ?? but after a day I updated my iphone so after I found an camera issue ( camera is shaking [ Rear Camera ] so guys I tried to replace the product but Amazon tolds me I have to go first in iPhone main showroom for diagnosis! Amazon just told me to go apple shop and told him what is happening with the phone , and if they deny to repair the product then I have to ask for (Denial report) so I firstly go in iVenus (apple authorised service centre) but they give me a job sheet not denial report but they refused to repair as well! Then after I go in Mumbai (Apple BKC) for service apple BKC is main showroom of iphone where they are very professional and talk in very fluent English as well! So they took my product for the repair then they took around 19 days to repair or replace the parts of my iphone !!! They replaced (Camera) but they also replaced Battery I asked why they replaced Battery so they told me some scratches on battery because they need to replace the battery !!! So guys this is my experience I shared with you !!!! I hope this will help you!."

Negetive,"Horrible battery backup. 60k phone barely gives you 3 - 3.5 hours SOT.If you are moving to ios from android get ready to be disappointed. A lot of things that we take for granted in android takes much more effort here, and they charge extra for it.Positive points areQuick/smooth transitional animationsSound qualityPicture and video qualityI found iphone to be an overhyped product."
Negetive,"Sold the phone on OLX after 6 monthsConsSummary============1. Bad notification center and management2. No back button3. Not able to pick calls sometime4. Worst file manager5. Poor keyboard auto-correct6. No credit card, tap and pay featureDetailed===============1. The notification center can become overwhelming, often leading to many unread notifications that can be easily missed.2. The absence of a back gesture makes navigation less intuitive and can be frustrating for users accustomed to this feature on other devices.3. The camera struggles to focus on small text, making it difficult to capture clear images of detailed documents or fine print.4. When the phone is locked, there's no option to decline incoming calls, which can be inconvenient in various situations.5. The phone's file sharing capabilities are restricted, offering fewer options compared to other devices, which can hinder productivity and convenience.6. The built-in file manager lacks functionality, particularly with no support for app-linked folders, making file organization and access cumbersome.7. Syncing with Google apps, especially Google Drive, isn't seamless and offers limited options, affecting the overall user experience and productivity for those who rely heavily on these services.8. The keyboard's autocorrect feature is always inaccurate and frustrating to use, making it advisable to switch it off for a better typing experience.9. The app placement on the home screen is terrible on the iPhone. Thanks for the update in iOS 18.10. No option to add credit or debit cards on Apple wallet or Google Pay for tap and pay feature. Available in all android devices.Pros===========1. No lag, every thing happens like snap2. Camera is so good4. Face id makes life easier.5. Haptics are excellent.6. Display is awesome."
Neutral,"After a month of using this phone, I am sharing this review.1. Phone is great in terms of build quality.2. Battery is like typical iPhone, nothing new experience. I charge my phone up to 80% only and it gives me a battery backup for 9 hours approx.3. After updating my phone to IOS 17.0.3 phone got a little bit slow.4. I'm facing a major problem related to Camera, whenever I'm using camera phone gets warm and near camera it get very hot. Major problem I am facing is in Potrait mode whenever I click 2-3 photos in portrait mode camera app crashes automatically.I don't know it's because of IOS version17.0.3 or something else.I received latest software version update of IOS 17.1.1 but im sure whether I should update or I should wait because I experienced the performance drop after updating to 17.0.3.I contacted customer support with my issue regarding camera but they didn’t gave me satisfactory resolution, they just told me to update my phone to latest Software version.Overall phone is nice."
Neutral,"tl;dr:If you can spend more money and want a better camera go with Pro or ProMaxIf you like the Apple EcoSystem you can get this else stick to AndroidPros :1. Good Display / Brightness (Supports Dark mode and You can control White Tone which is nice). It has 60Hz refresh rate but you won't feel the difference imho2. Good Battery Life (iPhone 13 Series has good battery life but ensure you have a supported charger) I use my MacBook's charger which charges the phone pretty quickly.3. Best Privacy Control4. Camera in Portrait Mode and Selfie Camera (LiveText Detection is a nice feature)5. Fast Processor / RAM management is good6. Great Resale value / Apple SupportCons:1. Screen size (6.1"" which is less in this price segment)2. Optical Zoom in 13 is not great (If you want a camera phone go with Pro or Pro Max or Android alternative)3. Third Party App Size is Huge (Gmail is 300MB / YouTube 250 MB). No native app lock option4. Very Less OS customizations / No Fingerprint Scanner (hopeful this gets better with iOS 16)5. No Native Support for mkv and other video formats (you can download a third party though)6. Native iOS Apps either require a subscription or are paid.7. File Management is restricted / Not easy to download *multiple* files from Telegram / Drive"
Negetive,Worst product ever and it's a used product. I sold it after 2 months of usage. All products in offer are used.
Negetive,Bahar ka phone be h diya hame ab iska lock nahi open ho raha ????????
Negetive,I dislike the product. The touch doesn't work properly. I wasted 77k on this.
Negetive,It is heating up when charging and being used 30 minutes.
Neutral,"I got the phone mainly for the camera. But it is very disappointing that even after paying top dollar you can’t get all the benefits of a good camera. iPhone can NOT take close up photos. It can’t zoom in on details. Also network and connectivity is poor. Whenever I’m traveling out of town the phone I’m unable to use mobile data. And even when in town, network is very poor. Apple and Jio aren’t the best even though they are assumed to be. Didn’t expect this from Apple.Cinematic mode is good. But it’s unable to focus on the subject properly a lot of times.Ear Speaker is malfunctioning right after just one year of use."
Negetive,"I have made a mistake of going with the hype and buying the iPhone...It's a useless piece of trash for 50k. No functionality whatsoever. Just a piece of showoff,nothing else. I also have put up an ad olx.Rather go for samsung S series"
Negetive,Not at all worth the wait and price. I phone 11 and 12 were better version at this price points. Nothing much has been changed. Check before you buy and make a good decision.
Negetive,No biometrics with many UI flaws. Too expensive at 90K range.Better wait for new versions so that the price will drop for this version substantially.

It’s good in camera if you know how to use it, it’s don’t have app lock you have to turn on aps lock by shortcut bt in this case your phone get locked whenever you try to open the locked app, and the battery quality is soo bad it goes down 100 to 30 in regular 2 hour usage and take maximum 3 hours to get fully charged 0-100. If you’re addicted in video calling it’s not at good if the other person doesn’t have iphone though you need to use google meet or whatsapp video call features but in iphone the google meet doesn’t provide its all features like you can’t shared your screen you can’t enjoying  meets all effects.

Positive,Good
Positive,Its a my dream phone. Always working proper and processor is strong and mainly camera is always better than other phone. But but i am unhappy withh main heating issue . Please solve the heating issue. At the charging time phone is always produced more heating.
Positive,Excellent features
Positive,"When talking about phone, Apple is always costly and there are always +ve and -ve for everything.I have been using android for 10+ year and now I moved to Apple.There are lot of applications and few features which I am missing while moved to Apple. But what really impressed me is the power of its processor and capabilities.1. When Android phone comes with 6, 8, 12 GB RAM, the speed or performance is poor. At the same time with 4 GB RAM in iPhone was really powerful and mindblowing.2. When Android storage are full, the phone will response very slow. But Apple still surprised me with the performance.3. The video quality of Anroid phone gives from 48 MP is delivered from Apple's 12 MP camera, which is mesmerizing and absolutely brilliant.- The battery back up is okay, but could have improved. (As I am not using for gaming, it is okay to me)- As Apple started production in India, the price could have reduced."
Positive,Good product delivered on time
Positive,"This device doesnt need any review as there are tons online , but as per my experience its all rounder champ. I bought 256 gb variant. All good till now.Just bit spectacular about the software updates if apple deliberately tries to downgrade the experience and camera quality.Camera quality:I felt iphone 14 gets better result not sure why? Although both device have same camera specs , is apple doing something fishy?Battery:Is decent ,usually lasts for a day."
Positive,Everything is good except amazon delivery time... Almost 25 days required to get this product
Neutral,The new I phone 13 purchased by me is developing overheating while using & charging. May be duplicate product being supplied online. My request to Amazon is to change the phone
Neutral,"USB cable was defective, it was not charging"
Neutral,"Hi, I was android user for tha last 7 years. I decided to switch to IOS finally.First of all 128gb variant was out of stock, so had to buy the 256 gb variant. I have used it for few months, and i have mixed opinions. I will list the cons and pros:-Pros-1) Battery life is awesome. Easily goes a day without charging twice with good amount of social media usages.2) Really smooth UI experience. Feels like 90 fps.3) Display is top notch. Though the screen size could have been bigger.4)Charging is fast as compared to other 20W charging phones.5) Good face unlock feature.6) Great picture quality tho there are some problems i have discussed in cons.6) feels and looks premiumCons:-1) Not android friendly. If u are switching from android, u will find it very difficult to use.2) Sells by the name of privacy, but no privacy features like app lock, lock during calls is available.3) Few apps stop working very often. This maybe just with my device as i have doubts that i have recieved a defective device.4) Slo mo videos lags and skip frames on my device. Will get it check by service center.5)No c type support6) Notification management is very poor.7) lack of fingerprint scanner( only android users)8)file system is very bad . They say that it is so to secure the privacy. But it really sucks.So, if u can go with the cons listed above u can consider it to buy. I will recommend continue to stick to android. For less price you can get a better deal."
Neutral,"Apple Marketing has done quite a good job month after month to keep people on their toes with their new launches where there is nothing great about this phone. I have been on Android for almost inception of phones and switching to iPhone is just a pain.1. No guide or help to transfer your critical data(Move to iOS doesnt work at all with high amount of data transfer.If you want to buy, go to brick and motor shop and get your data transfer then and there.2. Over hyped phone, nothing great i have found in the phone. May be i will find it better.3. Total stuck with ecosystem.4. At 90K they don't provide charger and are selling the same as extra. Total cheap strategy to earn more and promote their magsafe.I am not a happy customer till now! In a world where we talk about openness and open for integration, apple gives you a kind of black box... Boo to Apple!"
Negetive,iPhone is not functioning properly no Internet is deducting from sim only wifi is working
Neutral,I feel that my last ASUS android phone had a better battery life. An earlier iPad had a much much longer battery life.Rest is ok but the only issue that I am facing is with the battery.
Negetive,"Now filpcart is offering open box delivery but Amazon just giving so called secure delivery.. the delivery person even not allowed me to see the package is tampered or ok at time of delivery… my friend also have the same experience with Amazon n delivery person. Although I got genuine product, but everybody concerned about right product delivery. Amazon is my first choice when it comes to online shopping, but Amazon should be taken care of that and have to introduce open box delivery.  ?????? moreover Amazon offers open box delivery for dishwasher, TVs etc.. where chances are very less to have product issues or missing.. lastly you will get open box delivery for a Tv of 32” purchased @ around 10k but not for a IPhone like products even costing from few thousand to around one n half lack???? still don’t go with Flipkart they are looting customers even after giving open box delivery… many fraud sellers are registered on Flipkart … so if having to much concern directly go to store n purchase there, even at store you can get card discounts n cash back like offers. In worst case you will pay 2 3k more as compared to online shopping but you will surely get original products… choice is yours….????"
Negetive,Bad item

Positive,Nice phone delivered
Positive,Super I phone
Positive,"Go for it,??"
Positive,"First thing first, checked if the product was original or not. For that, check the following1. If the screen has “True Tone” option.2. Check the Serial Number for “M” letter, indicates its new unit.3. Check if IMEI number of the product is same as mentioned on the box.4. Battery Health should be 100%.Pros:1. Camera is one of the best I have used so far.2. Haptic feedback is very great. I noticed it instantly.3. Battery optimisation is very good. It’s been more than a month and I have never charged it more than 85%. Still I get a days battery easily.4. OS. I have used Android before this. And change in OS was good change as well.Cons:Charge speed is slow. I only charge it when the battery % is around 20%. And it takes 1 to 1.5 hr to charge.Comments:I don’t play any games or do any heavy usage tasks on phone. It’s just daily tasks like social media, YouTube, etc."
Positive,Camera quality is just awesome ??Battery life is also niceOnly problem you will face if you switch from Android is refresh rateAnd don't know but apple keyboard isn't made for chatting or typing in lo al language.
Positive,"I’ve been using the iPhone 13 for the past 3-4 months, and I am thoroughly impressed with its overall performance. The A15 Bionic chip ensures smooth and lag-free operation, making multitasking a breeze.The camera quality is a standout feature, capturing vivid and detailed photos in various lighting conditions. The Night mode improvements are noticeable, delivering clear and sharp images even in low-light environments. The Cinematic mode for videos adds a professional touch, creating engaging and dynamic content.The battery life has been reliable, easily lasting a full day with moderate usage. The 120Hz ProMotion display contributes to a silky-smooth experience, enhancing gaming and video playback.The design is sleek and feels premium, while the Ceramic Shield front provides added durability. The introduction of 5G connectivity ensures fast data speeds, enhancing the overall user experience.While the absence of a charger and earphones might be a drawback for some, the iPhone 13’s performance, camera capabilities, and design make it a worthwhile upgrade. Highly recommended for those seeking a top-tier smartphone experience."
Positive,Awesome camera quality.not very user friendly in compared to android.This was the reason why it really took me 6yrs to shift finally 2 ios when it was finally worth.Best option got under 42k. First the exchange offer didn’t worked when it was 46 k incl all discounts and when they increased the price by rs 2k then only exchange option worked may b they fooled us for a price point under 40k but still I m happy with the price point I hv got. In market it is still 60 k. Hassle free exchange got 4450 for a damaged screen for oppo a5s . So all around I was really very happy plus 2250 SBI credit card discount.
Positive,"Reviewing after 4 months of usage. Like everyone else I always wanted to buy an Iphone. Tbh, camera is the best about it. I still use an Android for daily use and I don't think Iphone interface is user friendly for a long term Android user. But yes, Iphone is really awesome for the camera!"
Positive,Very good phone and camera is awesome but battery is very weak
Positive,"It is amazing me everyday , so many practical and professional features are there ,Awsome display , 20% brightness is enough for indoor activities,The smoothness of the UI is next level experience, the fluid like experience will make you praise it every now and then ,The feel in hand is very premium, feels true to its valueThe battery backup is phenomenal, for normal usage , it can cover upto 1-1.5 day easily on 100% charge , more than that maybe , depends on the casual usageThe camera is out of the world , the colour accuracy is on point, it completely true to natural, you will totally get the colour as I saw when I was taking it ,The skin tone is very accurate for selfies ,Compact size makes it slide into the palm of your hand.Sound quality is very natural, very loud , vocals are clear , very pleasing to earsOne word its awsome, I have bought it for 46000 during sale , every penny of it is truly valued"
Positive,At this price point it's one of the best phones you can get! iOS is smooth as always and the camera setup as absolutely clinical. The downside tho is the minimal battery life but it can get you through an entire day.
Positive,Value for money
Positive,"The first time I am purchasing a apple product, and I am really happy with the product, performance and the delivery."
Positive,"Its a great product. Few things I did not like is the size. I would prefer small sized phones. The option was deprecated when I bought.Also I liked the previous control center coming from bottom and not from top corner, while the phone is big"
Positive,Good phone. Delivery also good. But invoice should contain IMEI number of iphone along with model details.
Positive,"Best value for money amongst 13, 14 and 15"
Positive,"I recently upgraded to the iPhone 13, and I couldn't be happier! The sleek design, stunning display, and lightning-fast performance make it a standout device. The camera quality is exceptional, capturing every moment with clarity and precision."
Positive,Fine product and value for money
Positive,Best phone
Positive,"Apple iPhone is my dream mobile. I am loving this till now, the only concern I'm feeling is, since it is a bit older version the OS updates may be less in the future."
Positive,"If you thinking to buy iphone 13, wait till great indian sale and bbd sale...you will get best discount on it...and in 2024 buy iphone 14...but if your budget id tight buy iphone 13."

Positive,Best phone from the iphone series
Positive,While playing camera and video recording the phone is getting heated
Positive,Touch
Positive,THIS IS THE BEST SMART PHONE I HAVE USED
Positive,First phone amazing
Positive,"The iPhone stands out as a testament to the blend of sophisticated design and cutting-edge technology that Apple is renowned for. With each new iteration, the iPhone continues to push the boundaries of what we expect from a smartphone.Firstly, the design of the iPhone is both elegant and functional. The sleek, minimalist look is not just about aesthetics; it's a reflection of the advanced technology housed within. The build quality is exceptional, with a premium feel that you notice the moment you hold it."
Positive,My phone screen got damaged by just applying little pressure. No dents or cracks. Full screen black green and blue. Took 27k just to replace screen by authorised service center.
Positive,"Its been a couple of weeks since i get the phone, everything is perfect but lately i got this issue with over heating, i do not play any games my phone usage is mild but still this heating won't stop. I am out of words because i paid so much for this and still got this issue. Is there anything we can do about this ? Suggestion accepted .Thankiu"
Positive,Very nice attractive phone serv8ce
Positive,Go for itI am using this phone for more than 6 months now and its working with charm since I bought it.Its still feels just like new for handling same as I used on day 1Really IOS is so polished that you wont be observing any lag or hang state on phone
Positive,Each thing is good but as visible midnight Black that is totally different which I find so could be better if it's totally black or z black.
Positive,"Just to be different, iPhone is there, useless OS, very few features, looks like a matchbox or a cigarette case. Use it if you want miss out on many great features of Android."
Positive,User friendly
Positive,Perfect business phone with excellent camera quality ..if yo love to do the photography its right choice
Positive,FANTASTIC is the word to describe the experience. Coming from 10 years as android user including Pixel 4.
Positive,Awesome performance. camera’s are beast
Positive,Amazing phone with great features. User friendly wont be switching to android again I think
Positive,The camera quality is very good and the proceser is actually surpriseing hai na ki nhi hai hai na tu baas
Positive,took some time to adapt the new interface from android but its all worth it in the end.What's Great?1. Display2. Camera3. Stereo Sound4. Battery5. User InterfaceWhat you will miss?1. Fingerprint scanner2. Jio switch to video call directly from voice call (Facetime !)
Positive,"Truely amazed with its performance, though I miss my second kidney .... Still happy and surviving... Go for it today..."
Positive,"After iPhone 4, I am going back to the Apple ecosystem, by purchasing iPhone 13. In the meantime I have used several Android and Windows phones. This is the best, though at a much higher cost. The battery life is a surprise, with a good life of over almost two days, with normal use."
Positive,"Scores high on style, looks, great camera, fast. iPhone set-up from previous versions of iPhone is very very fast and smooth. Entire set-up took just 10-15 mins and everything was copied over w/o any loss of data. Face ID set-up is very powerful. Battery life could be still better. Obviously price point could be a little more affordable."
Positive,It’s a great upgrade…camera is good..
Positive,Value for money
Positive,The midnight colour is little bit like navy blue and besides all the things are good and also I like the new cinematic mode of it.It’s good
Positive,"The smartphone marketplace has changed drastically over the span of the past few years. Over the years, it has become more competitive than ever before with a lot of smartphone makers launching their flagship devices every six months. Amid these challenging times Apple, like a bunch of other companies, has maintained a yearly update cycle for its iPhones. In this series, the company, as is customary, announced the iPhone 13 as its successor to last year’s iPhone 12.The newly launched iPhone 13 delivers minor upgrades over the iPhone 12, which includes a smarter camera, a brighter display, a bigger battery and of course, a more advanced processor to name a few. Then there are features like a smaller notch and a less pronounced rear camera module that might seem insignificant compared to the mentioned features but make a world of difference when it comes to usage. Sure, it’s a tad bit heavier than the iPhone 12 but if you compare it with some of the older iPhone models, like the iPhone 11 or the iPhone XR that I have been using, for what seems like aeons now, you will be grateful for everything that the iPhone 13 offers."
Positive,"Best camera with cinematic mode, the wide-angle is good,  but the night vision contains noise. the battery backup is good."
Positive,Apple full value of money
Positive,It's very beautiful and weight less so it's very easy to carry.So nice
Positive,I want to use this phone for my whole day work.
Positive,Packaging was very questionable but phone is great
Positive,Nice
Positive,Superb
Positive,"Moving from android to ios was not very easy however, now settling down slowly after initially facing lots of issue. Was expecting more from camera particularly in photo section and battery. Rest only time will tell If a U turn would be needed or not."
Positive,Perfect for iphone lovers.
Positive,"Build Quality is Far better than other competitors in market, one the best Smartphones under 60k. As I switched from Mi11x so I miss 120htz refresh rate in this Phone, but apart from that everything works perfectly especially Camera."
Positive,"I snagged the iPhone 13 during the Great Indian Festival for an unbeatable price of 45,000, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer in every way!Screen: The display is absolutely stunning – crisp, vibrant, and the colors pop like never before.

Negetive,"No star for product and services of amazon.I received used product. On unboxing it was found that temper glass was already affixed. Product was having zero charge(usually new products come with some charge). It takes around 45 mins to get 12% charge. On switching it on the phone setup was already done. While checking IEMI no displayed on phone was different to that mentioned on product box. Display was poor and touch response was too slow that I have to wait. Battery drains Soo quickly..Also, I have ordered for 128gb phone and they provide me 512 gb defective phone."
Negetive,Rear Camera not working and unable to replace mobile.
Negetive,Don’t buy iPhone from this Becoz of difference in price of 2k to 4K.they are giving damaged!!/copy piece even common people can difficult to diffrentiate.I have brought 4 months back camera is working /portrait camera is not working. So many software glitches are coming .so shameful to this reputed website.

Negetive,"I bought this phone and within 12 hours its display stopped working, replacement option is not working, Amazon customer service not connecting, its a total scam."
Negetive,Android is the best
Neutral,"I am using I phone product since its inception and happy with all its products but this is the first  I phone I bought from Amazon all other purchases were  made from I phone store.  To my disappointment it had issues like transferring data from my old I phone and also Gmail is not getting installed, couple of calls from Apple Customer support also couldnt fix the issue. They now said it will take 1 or 2 months to solve the issue. My visit to a Apple store in Kammanahalli Bengaluru-43, was also a disappointment as they said to fix this issue I need to pay 2600-00. Also Customer support mentioned there is difference if you buy from Apple store & buying from Amazon, the former  would have replaced the device immediately/solved the issue.:("
Negetive,Not satisfied with the packing of the shipment apart that product is genuine and upto the mark. Thanks
Negetive,Purchase in sale but lighting cable is duplicate and who know iPhone is original or not. Please don’t buy in sale or amazon or non authorised centre
Negetive,"After a long wait for Great indian festival , I ordered a iPhone 13 and received on 13th October,  the delivery also horrible. After receiving the product , for one day .I charged phone fully on 90%  but it always stop to 30% within 5 hours on low power mode without using any social network application , camera including web browser . the battery information gives report of clearly shows in graph ,  usage of phone. but power Downed for few hours after the full charge .then I contacted the Apple team. they suggested to reset the phone and update the latest  17 iOS. butI am not satisfied with the solution and then I contacted the Amazon customer care they gave a simple of it .It is a brand warranty . warranty so you should contact the Apple service centre . I paid 48000 for this one. Really I am disappointment with the both seller and brand also"
Negetive,"Heating , sounds not goodOnly name and brand practical experience very poorPeople buying for status only… this is the practical experience with 90% users"
Neutral,Apple is just a name. I was android user with little bit tech knowledge. There is lots of connivence is missing in iphone compare to android. I phone guys are still living in old age. OS is not at all user friendly.
Negetive,Had to purchase charger from outsideSo I like to rate it lowBut the phone itself is awesome ??
Negetive,"I paid 73,000 for a phone but they don't give a charger! Thats so cheap about apple. Apple told that they are not giving charger to cut down on waste. Good decision. If they think everyone has an iphone and compatible charger, then why they need to produce new phones in the first place? To cut down waste and save environment, they can stop producing phone as well, right? So all these corporate giants who talk about environment actually has a different intention. My 2 stars is not for the phone, but for their cheap tactics to cheat people."
Negetive,I order 9 oct and receive 20 oct to late delivery from Amazon
Negetive,Its just 2 days and the device is overheating…. Amazon service is worst…. they routed me to Apple service centre instead of replacing the phone
Negetive,Charger khrb ho gaya hai.. bht aarhinhai.. data cable khrb ho gayi hai..
Negetive,I am not satisfied.this phone Over heating camera not clearly

Positive,"The iPhone 13 is a solid upgrade, especially for those coming from older models. Its improvements in battery life, camera capabilities, and processing power make it a worthwhile consideration. However, if you already have an iPhone 12, the changes might not be significant enough to justify an immediate upgrade unless the new camera features or increased battery life are particularly important to you"
Positive,Phone looks good as expected and working is amazing.
Positive,"Though I am not so big techy, I am happy to use it easily without any hassles.  The phone is handy, slim and easy to operate.  With little effort, I could use it happily."

Positive,"I got 100% original product that too with proper packaging and no defect. Display, sound quality, camera all were perfect.Charging code is in the box with iphone"
Positive,Name at its best
Positive,Pros :- 1) Offcourse a clean apple os2) A beast for gaming3) Battery backup decent4) Display is best in the segment5) The feel when keeping it in hand was awesomeCons :- 1) Camera performance was very much decreased after upgrading to ios 17.4.12) Heat’s much while gaming and not using the a seperate fan for device
Positive,Good and very prompt delivery. It’s working fine
Positive,I'm happy with Amazon service.Original product delivered
Positive,Very nice
Positive,Really very smart
Positive,Satisfied
Positive,"iPhone 13 is best for all the features like its battery life is very good , display is ultra hd , this phone has very fast charging like in 1 hour it fully charge your phone , i have used this mobile since last year and this is best value for money mobile phone under this price . It is better then iphone 14"
Positive,"I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in many ways. The product I received was genuine, and the camera is absolutely lovely, capturing moments with stunning clarity and vividness. Overall, the iPhone 13 delivers a significant upgrade over my previous Android device, and although I was initially skeptical about downgrading from a 120Hz display to 60Hz, the phone's performance feels far from clunky or sluggish.The camera system on the iPhone 13 is nothing short of impressive. It produces stunning images, offering a level of detail and color accuracy.In terms of performance, the iPhone 13 truly shines. Its powerful A15 Bionic chip ensures smooth multitasking, seamless app navigation, and impressive gaming experiences. The device feels snappy and responsive, effortlessly handling resource-intensive tasks. I appreciate the optimized performance that comes with the iPhone 13.Now, let's address the issue that left me somewhat disappointed—the packaging. Considering the price tag of 61,000 INR, one would expect more attention to be paid to the packaging. Unfortunately, the phone arrived in a flimsy packet, which had clearly been subjected to the challenges of long-distance transportation. The iPhone box itself was damaged, but luckily, the phone inside was unharmed. It's disheartening to see such carelessness from the seller Appario Retail when it comes to packaging such an expensive device. I hope this issue can be addressed by the seller to ensure a better customer experience in the future.Despite the packaging mishap, the iPhone 13 has proven to be a remarkable device. If you're looking to switch from Android or upgrade from an older iPhone, the iPhone 13 is definitely worth considering."
Positive,"I’m not a phone fanatic but here is my simple and honest review.As someone who has only used windows and android phones I must say, iPhone is a good upgrade. I do, however, have some issues with the phone. If you are a hard core android user then you WILL face some issues. As in, the fact that iPhone does not have built in call recording feature. In the case of messages, you can reply from the drawer itself but does not have mark as read option. Truecaller absolutely does not work in this phone. I am a premium member on truecaller and it is of no use cause i still get bombarded with spam calls. Dual sim is one nano sim and the other e-sim, no dual tray for both your sim card. I am having issues with screencast/mirroring as well. In short, all the small little things that seems normal and one’s that you’re used to in an android is basically missing in an iPhone. Other than that the phone is great. Camera is great with a lot of features (which I’m still learning). Sound is great. No annoying nudges to keep updating apps. It’ll silently update in the background without the prompt message that it is being updated. Easy to use once you get the hang of it.Update:- i have been using this phone since March’23 so it’s been 2 months now and I have found that this phone is starting to lag a little. Not much, just a little but it is annoying (having spent so much money you’d expect more). Also, even with full network bars i sometimes struggle to get net connection. I have to rely on wifi most of the times and it has become a burden."
Positive,"Likes -1. A good display2. Great dual speaker sound quality3. It’s fast. I am using for more than a month and it never hanged.4. Updated to IOS 16 and unlike Android phones it is bug free or has very less bugs5. Long term software & security support (a very few Android phone manufacturers gives 5 years OS support with less bugs)6. Consistent camera. I would say the camera is not so hi fi but takes consistently good photos7. Apps are well optimized. Even google apps like YouTube, Maps, Gmail etc works better in IOS rather than their own proprietary OS8. Widgets in IOS 15 and 16. Android has widgets for decades now but IOS took the user experience to a whole new level.9. The new boxy design (introduced with iPhone 12) is cool and looks good.10. Network & call quality is good.11. Haptic feedback is awesome.Dislikes (Some dislikes are due to myself being an Android user for decades)1. The ugly notch. Though they made a dynamic island with iPhone 14 but lets accept the truth its still ugly compared to the hole punch2. Battery life & charging speed.3. Lack of customization. I can’t place the icons wherever i feel like on the screen.4. Lack of fingerprint scanner. Face id is good but fingerprint scanner is more practical, specially when you pay contactless5. Being an Android user I am used to with swipe from the right edge of the screen to go back. In iPhone this is not working & you need to reach out to actual back buttons of the app.6. Settings app is messy as all installed app would show up on the main page. I would say Android settings app is more sophisticated.7. Lastly the price should’ve been less. With all discounts & all it comes ~60k INR and its costly.Overall I am satisfied switching to iPhone 13 from Android (used OnePlus 6t for 3 years). Last time I switched to iPhone was with iPhone 5S and I couldn’t stay for 6 months and switched to Android again. But this time IOS is better in terms of consistency & user experience."

The A15 Bionic chip ensures smooth and lag-free operation, making multitasking a breeze.The camera quality is a standout feature, capturing vivid and detailed photos in various lighting conditions. The Night mode improvements are noticeable, delivering clear and sharp images even in low-light environments. The Cinematic mode for videos adds a professional touch, creating engaging and dynamic content."

Positive,Awesome experience after uses. It is totally value of money.
Positive,"We're pretty confident when we say that the iPhone 13 is the best iPhone for most people. It may look like Apple has only changed the position of one of the phone's back cameras since last year's model, but trust us when we say that there are more substantial upgrades than that. With a new display, larger battery, and better camera hardware and software, the iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones.Once again, Apple's made the iPhone 13 far more powerful than its Android competitors thanks to its 5G-ready A15 Bionic chip. If the raw performance doesn't interest you, photographers can play with the new Photographic Style filters in the camera app, while videographers will be excited by the new Cinematic mode focus-racking ability.The regular iPhone 13 has some flaws. The charging is still relatively slow compared to some Android phones. And I don't like that only the iPhone 13 Pro models get a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom. But based on my in-depth iPhone 13 review, this new iPhone is the best phone for the money.The overall display quality continues to be stellar. When watching the trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, I was mesmerized by the neon code encircling Neo as he walked down the street, and in another scene, I could make out individual hairs on Neo’s beard as he stared up into the sun.DISPLAY1. Smaller notch makes the display a bit more immersive2. Slightly different button placement3. Pink and blue are standout colors4. New Green color launched March 2022CAMERA1. Bright and colorful images beat Samsung2. Ultra-wide camera delivers more scenes and improved Night mode3. Photographic styles give you creative controlVIDEO1. Cinematic mode automatically changes focus on subjects while adding bokeh2. Superior Dolby Vision HDR video qualityPERFORMANCE and A15 Bionic1.A15 Bionic is the fastest chip once again2. Machine learning performance notably betterBATTERY LIFE1.10 hours and 33 minutes of battery life, which is 2 hours better than the iPhone 12Software1.SharePlay lets you watch videos and listen to music with friends2. Focus cuts down on distractionsVERDICT :The iPhone 13 improves on what was already the best iPhone for most people by introducing a bunch of welcome enhancements. I especially like the longer battery life, as the iPhone 12’s endurance was underwhelming even for a 5G phone. I wouldn’t recommend that iPhone 12 owners upgrade to the new iPhone, but the iPhone 13 is worth it if you own an iPhone 11 or older device.I don’t think many people will care about the smaller notch. What truly stands out on the iPhone 13 is the camera. The low-light performance is even better now, and computational photography features like Cinematic mode and Photographic styles flex the A15 Bionic’s muscles in ways that go way beyond benchmarks.I’m also glad Apple doubled the starting storage at 128GB, as that move was overdue and puts the new iPhone on par with Android flagships. I’d like to see Apple offering faster charging next time around — be it via USB-C or MagSafe — as well as a 120Hz display.The bottom line is that the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and raises the bar for what you think a camera phone can do."

Negetive,Same as iphone 12 expect camara not satisfied go with I phone 12 if you want best camara then I phone 13
Negetive,"SLIGHT speed difference, more batter backup for more than 12 Not worth it Go for 12 instead.. No difference at all"
Negetive,This product is duplicate of iPhone 12 only camera design changed. Very low quality of this product Buy Samsung mobile phone
Positive,Pranto chakdaha Nadia West Bengal
Positive,Has a good battery life. Charging is decently fast. Camera quality is unmatched. Excellent screen and display. Very easy and simple to use.
Positive,"The phone is awesome. The smoothness, the camera quality, display and the voice clarity are great. There is way better safety as every app asks to get tracked or not, to send you notifications or you can deny it. The phone in itself is so smooth and it’s so easy to edit videos or reels as no lagging is there.While the experience of switching from android to iOS was great, but there are so many things which are way more complicated in iOS.I can’t use true-caller and have to manually check the number, no headphone jack and airpods are kinda not useful for someone who talks for long hours on calls. (Planning to get the lightning cable wired apple earphones).Also, the fact that it does not have fingerprint is kinda shocking as phones starting from 10k also have that feature now, guess apple should really look in to it.Overall, I feel the pros outweigh the cons.Lastly, the BEST feature is the camera. The crystal clear quality of the camera was one of the reasons why I wanted to get the phone. My father has a Z fold, and personally I like the camera of the iPhone 13 way way better. Could be a personal preference, but I am satisfied."
Positive,Good One
Positive,I got this for 46k with all discounts it was good deal.. camera quality is awesome..
Positive,Nice
Positive,"I just love this model! Yes please would argue that it’s an old model but hear me out. The battery backup is substantially better than 14/15. The camera quality stands at power, the charging even tho not C type charges pretty quickly, the base and the speakers it’s pretty good. And even though the refresh rate is not that great, but it’s the exact same in 14/15.Not just that but there have been certain major issues with both those models that have put them on a really low selling models for Apple."

Negetive,"""I never thought that I would receive such a bad iPhone from Amazon when I ordered it online. My iPhone is taking extremely blurry photos and it heats up quickly, within 10 minutes of using Instagram or snap. when I called customer service for a replacement,they refused to exchange it directly. This is the first time I bought an iPhone and I had a hard time saving up for it. I thought the camera would be great, but it is taking very blurry photos and overheating. I bought it for Rs. 60,499 because there was a bigger discount than on Flinkart but now I regret buying it from here because I think the seller sold it to me for a lower price due to their own faulty iPhone 13."" My only request is that you replace my iPhone 13 as soon as possible...Send a message..."

Negetive,"The iphone had manufacturing defects.. on minimal use of camera, it gets heated up in the volume buttons area. Plus if zoomed more than 1x the photo and video is shaky beyond bearable and there is a buzzing sound that can be heard near the cameras. Reviewing it after a week of purchase. Since I doubt this seller will not replace it, I sent it to apple service center at Guwahati."
Neutral,You're paying money just for the brand name.Android devices from Samsung and OnePlus provide much more value.
Negetive,Overpriced battery backup also low
Negetive,"Don’t buy iphone in Amazon ,you will receive a non apple charger cable and it is very difficult to claim a warranty and icare Amazon will be playing blame game.I have experienced myself a problem where charger cable wasn’t working and icare said that cable is non apple product."

Negetive,It has a blurr display I noticed it in  8 days n could not replace it.
Negetive,"Phone Packing is aTampered , speaker of the phone is not as per orginal quantity"
Negetive,From 12 hours and multiple try the iPhone is struck to update the latest version… Poor quality support from Amazon.
Negetive,"I bought iphone with exchange of old phome my exchange phone was all good no value depreciation still after giving otp the delivery person asked for 1500 more it was genuinely showing on his app but i asked him about did you made changes in exchange value he said no ,i wasnt isimply put an otp and it shows me 1500 to be paid ,i wasnt sure but i paid in surge of excitement by paytmNow i am expecting answers from amazonNever had such experienceApart from it phone was genuine and good no complaints about it"
Neutral,"The phone is very good but the color quality of its frame is not good, I took this phone 4 months ago, now its color is coming out."
Neutral,I don’t see 5G option under cellular mobile data
Neutral,Battery life not up to mark
Negetive,Don't buy this go for samsung s21 fe they have many features less that this price and there good lock app and creativity in camera very good
Negetive,Now a days from Amazon mostly bad service and bad quality products.Very pathetic response from Amazon customer care person whom I discussed he said go contact with company outlet and disconnect my call while I am explainingI can't give zero rating also
Negetive,Battery back up is very low  description shows 20 plaback hours bt hardly if we use its just for 5 to 6 hours. Disappointed with battery nd temperature of Phone nd phone gets heated up for just usage of half an hour

Negetive,I couldn't make the call go to speaker.
Negetive,iPhone stopped working after 7 Day'sGoing Dead...Apple Denied to Service..
Negetive,The battery drains too quickly for a new phone. Hate it.
Negetive,After 9 months I used this is worest experiencePerformance is poor
Negetive,"I bought a new device, opened the packet and it was a defective device. I contacted Amazon for replacement, and they redirected me to apple despite, amazon India has clearly stated that the item is replaceable within 7 days of purchase. Apple detected it as a defective piece and it had to be repaired. I reasoned with them that it's a new product and I don't want to get a repaired or refurbished product. But they said since it is bought from Amazon they cannot replace it, had it been bought on their website or store they would have surely replaced it.Came back to amazon, telling them my experience with Apple as it's a defective product. Apple is suggesting that would also have replaced it, so Amazon please replace it. They denied it flatly. when I asked about why they have mentioned 7 days replacement, on this they don't even say a word but simply repeated themselves that the best advice I have already given to you is that you have to go to Apple there is nothing amazon can do about it. The end experience is exhaustion and frustration, customers have only right to these companies' fat money and make them richer and richer. This is nothing but a legal extortion racket."
Negetive,"When I opened the box 1 very small dent was observed at edge, also after using for one month I am giving this review.This phone has super sound and network issue. I am not getting any support from Amazon or supplier end. Every time the person on other side can't hear my voice"
Neutral,"Except camera and some features, nothing is great and not value for money.iOS : full of bugs. They give you updates for the bugs, but the updates will give you another bug. Not all applications are available and most of them are paid apps.Buy a 40k Camera and 16k Android phone. That is perfect option. You will get decent camera in 16k phones. For Pro use, you can use the 40k camera."
Negetive,I requested to all persons if they want good battery backup then don't buy iPhone 13 because his backup is only 7 to 9 hours after charging one time
Negetive,"I bought the Midnight colour and Phone is working fine, but there is a white discolouration around the camera lenses. I contacted Amazon and they denied my replacement request said they want service denial letter from Apple to get it replaced ."
Negetive,"Camera not good, Battery performance is very poor, charging slow, display ok , very Bad experience in operating system.  don't buy apple device"
Negetive,found scratches on my new iPhone 13 and I am unable to replace such a hateful Amazon customer support team I have faced today
Negetive,"When over call and screen is black, phone hangs and then it take minutes to recover. Didn’t expected this from iphone.And also price dropped by 12000, just after I purchased. Even amazon didn’t provided any price review. So disappointing. Don’t buy"
Negetive,Withinna week phone is corrected ..Amazon sells me a defective product
Neutral,"This is my first IPhonePhone looks and feels premium in hand, definitely you cannot compare with Chinese android phones.Battery is sufficient for normal day to day use, if you use hotspot then it will be drained in 5 hours, I don’t play games so can’t comment.Security, OS and hardware comprised intact kudos to apple for that, this is where iPhone stands out from other phones.Volume and camera is amazing and you feel next level if you are switching from Chinese smart phones. Same Dolby and oled display feels premium in iphone.Didn’t explore much on apple eco system, how ever I understood that you need to spend some extra bugs than usual if you want to be a premium user of apple eco system.Nothing comes for free here, in fact you would loose the freedom of being an android user (less customisation and no side loaders)In a good way, if you respect your privacy, security and getting premium services in the market you should choose iPhone.New users are good to go for iPhone 13 with few extra grands with the current offers, you will get extra features that are missing in 12.12 users forget about upgrading to 13 it will be a joke for you, it won’t worth it."
Negetive,Screen froze has accrued in new i phone
Neutral,I received the iPhone 13 3 days ago but still now I haven't insert any sim card.. But when I makes it on and uses for 5 to 10 minutes it's automatically becomes hot.. What may the problem otherwise advice what to do ...
Neutral,"iPhones are expensive, the only part which may justify it’s price is the camera. Switched from Android.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND switching to ios, liked android way better as the file management system was just off the charts.If you like owning expensive stuff go for samsung flip/fold series"
Neutral,"iPhone 13 is good even in 2024, if you got it under 40k. The battery will be your permanent consirn if you are switching from android."
Negetive,"I am facing battery problem. The battery drops 26% within 4 to 5 hours in ideal conditions, even with the internet off and no third-party apps downloaded.This is my first Apple phone. I have spent my hard-earned money and now I feel cheated."
Negetive,Whenever there is a phone call the other person can never hear voice clear
Neutral,1) Bluetooth does not work 2) Phone hit issue
Negetive,"The phone is amazing. However, amazon offered users for an instant discount for SBI debit/credit card  users at the time of payment. This was not applied for my purchase although i used my SBI debit card. Tried talking with customer service, and sent email to support team. None was resolved, and not even heard from the team even after a month. Such a disappointment."

Positive,"Long time android user here, I bought the iPhone 13 as a replacement of my android mid range and also to shoot Youtube videos as I think an iPhone offers better value than any 60-70k vlogging cam. Absolutely love the camera, battery backup, the build quality-just no words there. Unlike android, I do not have to worry for extended zoom and g calls--very reliable. Definitely, Apple got another long time iPhone customer."
Positive,Perfect phone with all the features and security guranteed. Price doesn't matter for such a boss. Working like butter ??
Positive,Nice product. Sturdy and best for security. Very less data visible or less ads. Nice product. Loved it. Recommended.. Afterall its iphone
Positive,Brand wise good phone. Though expensive but better for those who don't have much use and they are looking for safety quality and brand
Negetive,"After 5months of using suddenly my iPhone got stuck with apple logo with pink line on the screen , when gave for icare service , they denied for service bcz they said it was a tampered device . When I gave it for local service shop they said  motherboard has been corrupted and battery was swollen and there was corrosion on motherboard bcz of water traces  which could have occurred long back .I think I had received a refurbished iPhone and everyone denied to help regarding this problem including Amazon and Apple support. Never buy iPhone from Amazon  bcz at end no one is going to help us ."
Neutral,I want to replace charging chord of my iphone as its not working i bought the phone on 21st oct 2023
Neutral,Night Mode camera is awesome

Negetive,I need to replace my product as soon as possible it's camera is not working . It takes lot of time in switching the camera from back to front . Refund my money or replace the product I want a new one as soon as possible ! Not at all taking pictures .
Negetive,"During phone conversations, the my voice intermittently breaks, making it difficult for the person on the other end to understand.  Communication becomes unclear and frustrating, affecting the quality of the call.And it is not due to network issue.Also tried restart and everything. Any solution? What is the policy to get a replacement?"
Negetive,Very bad
Neutral,"Very good product, must buy. Thank You."
Negetive,Now we can buy iPhone 14 in the same price range. That will give more features.

Positive,"Awesome apple. 13 mini is handy. Easy to carry. Light weight. And very effective in daily usage. Battery is effective according to daily usage. Pictures, sound output, is always the best. Finally completed the 6 months emi. And finally the product is mine. ????"
Positive,The battery backup is good. The security features are great. I always receive notification with regards to security settings of the app and unlike in an android phone where many aspects of access rights are masked. The UI is brilliant and the speed of the phone is great
Positive,"If you are someone who is into good software experience than iphones are for you. If you can’t afford it then don’t buy it. Battery is improved, camera is good looks good and feels good thanks amazon"
Positive,Red colour is very attractive ????
Positive,Camera 10/10Display 10/10Battery 10/10No connectivity issue  as I have faced in one plus nord 2 and Samsung a52s 5gAll-rounder phone I have never seen  recommended to everyone but expensive

Negetive,My device is not working (switched off)Iam not able to download Invoice and warranty documentHow can I get itService center asking the document
Negetive,"The phone is great, the problem i faced is incorrect serial number in the invoice. Have been contacting customer service for more than a month, still not sorted! Would recommend everyone to check the serial number in the invoice with the actual product"
Neutral,Battery drains fast and it should not be priced more than Rs 60000
Negetive,"Have Dent on the edge after checking trying to replace the product but we unable i have try many ways to replace  so please don,t buy fom online plateform this expensive phones ."

Positive,Its been more than 3 months since i purchased this during great Indian festival season in oct... quality is impressive... packaging is impressive but only one thing that i give it 4stars that amazon didn't provide open box delivery for this order....?? otherwise no issues...
Positive,"My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.I have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I can’t believe what I’m seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn’t disappointing.Display quality is truly flagship level and I’m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I don’t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.Speakers are Great.Battery life is better than my previous devices,iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.Truly worth it."
Positive,Nice
Positive,It’s a perfect iPhone I highly recommend this seller . Great price on their sale. The phone is good
Positive,What I like about this phone is that it is quite reasonable comparing other iphones and Is very good and nice to use.
Positive,I bought the product little expensive. Within a month price dropped by Rs.17000.
Positive,"Though we talk a lot about high price for iPhones, this is worth the amount. Smooth touch, perfect to hold in hand. For the screen size of 6.1"", it looks small overall. I could have gone for pro max but more than 1.5L budget is way too much for me :-)* Good battery back-up (With low battery mode always on, 5 hours of talk-time, around 2 hours of twitter and 2 hours of whatsapp usage, 1 hour of songs listening, 1 hour of rummy/candy crush games and notification of all these items, the battery comes for more than 24 hours for me)* Getting charged quickly from 20% to 100% within 2 hours* Perfect camera and I love that 'Live' photo option* Body design is awesome. When I held it in my hand for the first time, felt really happy about the design and the size of the iPhone 13."
Positive,Loved it
Positive,There’s no same day delivery Phone was delivered to me in 3-4 days. I had to purchase  the phone thrice so on the third attempt I finally received the phone. Battery life is better than iPhone XR. Phone is same as shown in pictures. Amazon refund policy is good. I received both refunds within 24 hours.
Neutral,Not worth
Neutral,Nothing new features only model changed
Negetive,Seals were teared but only stricker was put. I don't know whether it is new or refurbished but it's working ??????.
Neutral,"Reviewing after 2 months usage.+ve:1. Battery2. Display3. Camera-ve:1. Screen not responding in all the corners, I need to click three or four times2. Portrait mode pictures , one plus does better than this3. Phone got Stuck three times4. When I play PUBG/BGMI fire button takes some time to respond (not sure it’s BGMI issue ) and also with mobile data BGMI not able to handle extreme graphicsNote : these are all my experiences  as new iPhone user who used Oneplus7 earlier."
Negetive,Battery backup is pathetic ..Regretting buying it :( it's not even one month and I have two charge it twice and thrice :( return window is closed now else I would have returned it
Negetive,"Wifi issue after 6-7 months, wifi remains connected but can't open any websites, after switching to mobile network, things works well"
Negetive,It is not good for use
Negetive,Price: 81kProblem: 1. Heating issue2. Poor battery lifeThat's all from my side now it's your choice.. ??
Negetive,Very worst
Negetive,"very poor performance of IOS. This is a very big mistake in my life to i bought this iPhone.I would tell all of you that you should never buy an iphone in your life. This is a very useless phone, no function works well in it."
Positive,Best
Positive,"This phone has well balanced HD oled sDisplay. Colours are accurate. Camera quality is very good even with 12 MP cameras. Selfies and portrait look good, but selfies indoor required little improvement which can be done through software. Battery back up is great. Faster transfer using Airdrop. I am getting a 1 and half day of battery backup with normal usage. Overall a perfect smartphone with ios experience."
Positive,Good not like android
Positive,Good charge
Positive,Actually I’m android user now switched to iPhone user experience is good but camera quality isn’t meet my expectations when taken photos on day times and little low lights you’ll get good quality photos. Night mode is worst. Battery is good for moderate users. Phone is very compact and display quality really awesome. My conclusion if you looking for privacy and protect from hackers definitely iPhone is safe. Those who are all moderate user and then buy this model
Positive,Very good I am happy
Positive,Premium product
Positive,"Real, good and amazing product"
Positive,"This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things."
Positive,"The iPhone 13 128GB has surpassed my expectations in every aspect, setting a new standard for smartphone excellence. From its sleek design to its powerful performance and innovative features, this device has truly redefined what it means to own a premium smartphone.Design and Build Quality:The iPhone 13’s design is a masterpiece of craftsmanship, featuring a sleek aluminum frame and a stunning ceramic shield front cover. The device feels incredibly premium in hand, with its compact form factor and exquisite attention to detail. The IP68 water and dust resistance provide added durability and peace of mind, making it perfect for everyday use.Display:The Super Retina XDR display of the iPhone 13 is nothing short of breathtaking. The 6.1-inch OLED screen delivers vibrant colors, deep blacks, and excellent brightness levels, ensuring an immersive viewing experience for everything from streaming videos to browsing the web. The True Tone technology adapts the display to ambient lighting conditions, providing a comfortable viewing experience at all times."
Positive,"I've been using the Apple iPhone 13 (Blue) for six months now, and it's been fantastic. Here's my take:Design:The blue color looks really cool and the phone feels premium. It's sleek and comfortable to hold.Screen:The display is sharp and bright. Watching videos and scrolling through photos looks amazing.Speed:This phone is super fast. I've had no issues with lag, even when playing games or multitasking.Camera:The cameras are awesome. Photos come out clear and vibrant, and it works great in low light too. Video recording is top-notch. Battery:The battery life is solid. I get through a full day easily, even with heavy use. Fast charging is a nice plus.Software:iOS is smooth and easy to use. I love how well it works with my other Apple devices.Overall, the iPhone 13 is a great phone and I'm really happy with it. Definitely recommend it!"

Positive,"After purchasing the iPhone 13, I’m genuinely impressed with its performance and features. Here’s a detailed review based on my experience:### Design and Build QualityThe iPhone 13 feels incredibly premium in hand. The flat edges and matte finish on the back give it a sleek and modern look. The build quality is top-notch, with the Ceramic Shield front adding a layer of durability that gives me confidence in its longevity.### DisplayThe 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning. The colors are vibrant, and the blacks are deep, making everything from photos to videos look fantastic. The brightness levels are impressive, and even in direct sunlight, the screen remains perfectly readable. The slightly smaller notch is a nice touch, offering a bit more screen space.### PerformanceThe A15 Bionic chip is a powerhouse. The iPhone 13 handles everything I throw at it with ease, from multitasking to gaming. Apps open almost instantly, and there's no lag whatsoever. It’s clear that this phone is built for speed and efficiency.### CameraThe camera system on the iPhone 13 is a standout feature. The 12MP wide and ultra-wide lenses capture stunning photos with great detail and color accuracy. Low-light performance is particularly impressive, thanks to the sensor-shift optical image stabilization. The new Photographic Styles and Cinematic mode are fantastic additions, allowing for creative freedom and professional-looking videos.### Battery LifeBattery life has been a pleasant surprise. I easily get through a full day of use on a single charge, even with heavy usage. The efficiency of the A15 Bionic chip and the slightly larger battery make a noticeable difference compared to previous models.### SoftwareiOS 15 is smooth and intuitive. The new features like Focus modes, enhanced FaceTime capabilities, and improved privacy controls make the user experience even better. Everything feels well-integrated and easy to use.### Overall ImpressionThe iPhone 13 has exceeded my expectations. It offers a perfect balance of performance, design, and innovative features. Whether it’s the stunning display, powerful camera system, or impressive battery life, every aspect of this phone feels well-thought-out and polished. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a premium smartphone experience."
Positive,Good product
Positive,I am satisfied with the product and schedule
Positive,"Stunning Display: The Super Retina XDR display is vibrant and sharp, making everything from photos to videos look fantastic.Performance: Powered by the A15 Bionic chip, the iPhone 13 handles multitasking, gaming, and demanding apps with ease."
Positive,M loving it ......
Positive,"Well, it’s an iPhone."
Positive,Decent Phone. Working like a charm
Positive,"Got it for 65K on Amazon prime day. So as a lifelong android user I have switched to IOS. So will be dividing this into the pros and negs:Product red 128GBPros:1) Received genuine product from Amazon( was quite sceptic about it though)2) Built quality excellent3) Camera quality excellent. True to life color reproduction, Indoor conditions amazing, night photos are good, facial tones are very good, day clicks are amazing. In short it's an amazing exp. Selfie cam also produces very good quality images. And also no shift in dynamic range while shifting B/W wide and ultra wide cams.4) Display:- Its a really great display, not 120 hz, but the experience is no less than a 120 hz, coz of apple's great software optimization, buttery smooth, no jitters on the screen, won't feel like a 60 hz panel. Now the notch, yes it will be bothering a little bit but its got its own functions, face unlock and stuff (works great in all environmental conditions)after a little while you get adjusted and it got its own magic functions like when when the phone rings and you go close to it, it detects your presence and lowers the vol level.5) Performance: Most powerful processor in the world.6) Battery:- With light usage will easily go for 2 days and with heavy 1 day. Remember to follow a charging pattern and it will give a solid battery exp.7) Speakers: Very loud with a small thumpCons:1) To keep photos and stuff you need to buy storage. 5 GB by default but that's nothing. Download google photos as an alternate sol. if you don't wanna buy storage.2) File management system sucks, android is much better.3) It has dolby atmos but for that you need a subscription to Apple music.4) Does not have a telephoto cam, which I think is a must at this price point.5) Somehow I am not getting 4g+ on my airtel, don't know why but in my android phone always used to get that.6) No USB C7) Siri is dumb AF8) Apple maps are not good, so download Google maps.9) Google keypad is much better than apple's.10) Notification panel and those small things like typing in the notification panel and other things that you can do in android is much much better than apple.11) As of now no haptic feedback while typing maybe coming on IOS 16Note:- Apple ecosystem still exploring that part but whenever you click any pic it automatically gets updated and I can see it in my Macbook also.Overall I would say if you are planning to buy a phone for responsiveness and does the everyday stuff without any hanging problems and stuff then buy it, and also if you are planning to keep it for a long time, then I think its a good investment for the future. Its got Great resale value.Hope this helps in making your decision easier.Update after 2 weeks of usage:All the above points remains the same, but I did check out the ecosystem and the experience has been amazing.1) I can receive and make phone calls (cellular calls) from my macbook, and the call quality is also good.So basically you can keep your phone in some other section of the house and you are working with your macbook somewhere else and if some call comes you can receive that on your macbook. PS:- your phone and macbook should be connected to a similar network, i.e wi-fi.2) Airplay- Just from the lock screen itself i can play any video and also listen to music from my phone. So basically you can watch youtube amazon prime videos(app not in the macbook but present on phone) and other stuff and also listen to music, and the switch of devices is also seamless. So someone in my house can use my macbook to watch movies on amazon prime(playing from my phone) and I can browse linkedin or FB from my iphone."
Positive,Affordable priced iPhone. Great build quality and fabulous user experience
Positive,"I used this phone is very smooth, fast, camera quality is natural photos, performance is great i play call of duty very nice ????"
Positive,I have been using this phone since 1 year its good after all
Positive,No words…. Excellent phone as usual from Amazon
Positive,nice product
Positive,Father gift
Positive,This thing is a beast...Battery drain hi nahi hoti.# Nazar na lagey
Positive,Product is great
Neutral,Heats up fastly and battery drops soon
Neutral,"I switched from Oneplus 5t to iPhone 13. The reasons I switched was 1. Battery life of Oneplus 5t deteriorated rapidly and OnePlus hardly cared to explain this. I also suspected that OnePlus deliberately created a bug that led to sudden drop in battery life. 2. Wanted to get an Android phone but could not find even one decent phone that did not have heating issues. 3. Oneplus device also suffered from Screenburn.Having switched the battery life is sorted and the phone does not have any heating issues but iPhones lack basic features such as1. Display of date and time on status bar2. The rounded edges of the phone create a problem as some apps with options at the bottom of the screen are not properly displayed.3. Amazon App does not allow purchase if Kindle books on iOS devices.4. Typing is a problem as the screen is smaller compared to a OnePlus device.Overall, I am neither too happy nor too sad with the purchase though I must confess that price of the phone seems exorbitant vis a vis the value delivered."
Neutral,First and Foremost thing Camera its just okayish and Hyped one i found it to be equivalent to a 30-40 k range android phone.Battery Backup is top notchDisplay is good.IOS is really bad ?? you can't tweak and play around like in android and you have to use itunes or a 3rd party app to just copy your files.For time being this is my review. If you are an ios user you can upgrade to it. If you are an android user there are way better options than this iphone.Just don't go with the hype and end up buying this. It's my opinion not value for money product. It's not worth it.
Negetive,Phone is good but not worth the price. In this price segment you can get far better options in Android
Neutral,"As for the brand, it is the best, but I am facing a problem with my iPhone getting warmer or heated up as I have used it for a long time, like continuously for 30 minutes. If the provider reads the review, please answer me if I can get it fixed. Thank you."
Neutral,Product is unserviceable within 3 days and submitted at icare.
Neutral,"Not up to mark, somany glitches, and when contacts service support and centre physically both advise for formate and reset mobile, if u don’t want mobile for show off then go for better options with higher end android.Siri not working properHeating issuesBack button missing"
Negetive,"I RECEIVED IPHONE 13 ORDERED FROM AMAZON, IN WHICH FRONT CAMERA, REAR CAMERA, TORCH AND FACE ID NOT WORKING, AND I NEED TO REPLACE THE PRODUCT FOR WHICH I'am SOLD WITH A DEFECTIVE IPHONE 13. NO PROPER RESPONSE FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAM FINALLY PRODUCT WAS NOT REPLACED IAM FORCED TO SERVICE THE PHONE.WASTE OF MONEY.PLEASE DONT BUY I PHONES FROM AMAZON"
Neutral,Battery is draining very fast also i did not get option to replace. Also they charge 1900rs for charger but it charge iphone 13slowly
Negetive,"Really bad experience from Apple, I purchased iphone13 in May-2022 and in Aug-2022 I got a screen flickering issue, and the whole screen turned blue. I took it to Icare they took my phone for 1 week and then returned back saying they couldn’t replicate the issue, now after 2weeks of using on 13th sep I did a ios16 upgrade and then the same issue repeating, blue screen. On 14Th sep the whole screen turned black, I asked Apple for replacement with a new device as after paying so much money and hardly using for 3 months I don’t want to use a repaired iPhone. I contacted Apple but they are not saying or helping me for replacement."
Neutral,Not good as expected
Neutral,Don’t go for 6.1 in feels ver small .After buying iPhone 13 it fee  very small ans compared to android phone . You can get 6.6 or more bigger screen and no c type  charging port .It’s better to buy iPhone 14 Pro you get 6.7inch display and c type charging port and also videos are more stable in this.
Negetive,"It's been less than a year and I am facing overnight battery draining issue, to give you an example i charged my phone at 78% yesterday at 7.40 PM and today morning at 97.00 AM the battery got drained upto 22%. I have not even touched my phone. I tried many things ,I was using low power mode, stopped background application refreshing, and even turned of wifi,mobile data and location. This was the costliest phone i bought last year and this has serious battery issues."
Negetive,Battery backup is very very poor
Neutral,Still trying to understand the computations on one hand and to understand shift from android to iphoneI thought hanging would never happen but it seems as if you would just need to optimise your usage among different apps and understand the shift better.If you are trying to shift from androud its best to try pro or pro max so that you wouldnt notice the shift
Neutral,"I did not find my iPhone 13 of much utility, even after 5 months of usage. Problems that I faced:Siri neither hears commands nor performs any action (7/10 times).Doesn’t have Split Screen- becomes impossible to multitask eg making notes while watching a video.Can’t take Long Screenshots unless you’re reading a book.Wi-Fi takes a lot time to connect.Calculator is too basic. Doesn’t even have history for the ongoing transaction, forget about storing previous transactions.No option to record calls while the other person can record you.WhatsApp for iOS can’t do strikethrough nor monospace.  Forward & share options are quite time consuming. You can’t edit status privacy after you’ve selected the media files (photos/videos) to be uploaded. I’m mentioning features of WhatsApp because it’s an app that is used by most iPhone users in India!There are some good things about iPhone 13 which include:• A toggle switch to quickly silence the phone.• Battery Life is good.• Display: doesn’t cause strain on eyes too easily.• Picture Quality is good in broad daylight but they are a tone darker than real. So you have to use editing features every time. However, ‘copy and paste edits’ feature- lets you apply same editing features (except rotation) to many photos at once."
Neutral,Everything is good except after delivery service by Amazon Amazon won’t take responsibility if anything’s happens after delivery
Neutral,"Good iPhone, not so good camera. I mean, dont doubt the camera as bad or worst, its just that I didnt expect the camera to be by default wider that Samsung phones. And if I went to 0.5x, man its the widest I think on a phone. So if you wanna take wide shots, this is the phone, else, stick to android I would say. And Did I mention about how exciting the OS. Man, you gotta use this OS if your life is too happening and you want to slow it down(pun intended). Im telling this after using this for like 15+ months now. Battery life was good before the iOS16 updates, now its meh..."
Negetive,"Very disappointed due to the system performance and serious network issues, no support from customer care support, suggested to update and after that asked to submit at service centre"
Negetive,Not really happy with the camera quality.. doesn’t seem like iPhone pictures .. especially the night pics .. they r really blur
Negetive,You have to pay 95000+ for this stupid phone which doesn’t make any sense especially when they don’t even pack a charger and 120hz display in such an expensive phone. Buy Google pixel phone instead.
Negetive,No big upgrades at all!! It’s the same as iPhone 12 except that they changed the camera designed! Apple STOP FOOLING US
Negetive,"Apple quality is pathetic, poor quality product delivered. Started hanging in 12 days post purchase. Amazon is requested to ensure return, refund or replace."
Negetive,Phone is too much heating during clicking photos and watching videos. Also paint scratches in back side near camera lenses. Looks like phone is not original.
Positive,excellent product!! Amazon is great like jeff bezos
Positive,Over performance of the phone is nice
Positive,"Nice phone , iam fully satisfied this phone"
Positive,Value of money. Very hard and tough. Working normal even after sinking in water two times.
Positive,Was not thinking to buy it but iphone 14 se zyada acha camera quality laga.No heatingFast chargingDam good displayBeast performanceVery good soundAnd a medium small which I personally don’t likeCamera is outstanding
Positive,"Battery time was low , often need to charge two times a day"
Negetive,"Phone, Email & SMS management extremely unfriendly, primitive and restrictiveUnnecessary animation on each actionVery bad user experience"
Negetive,Need immediate replacement of the iPhone
Negetive,dust particles in back camera
Negetive,"Camera , battery, screen and speaker quality is very bad"
Negetive,Overheating
Neutral,"Rest of the things are great like the speed, rear camera and battery but very disappointed with the front camera, even my 20k android phone had better front cam, specially in low light. Its low light selfie looks like taken from a basic android phone."
Negetive,very very very bad product i have ever seenbatery is alsovery poor only one thing is good its performance
Negetive,"Worst iphone ever. Unbelievable issues like frozen screen, hangs a lot, miss behaving on charging, glitches when Switching normal to bluetooth or between apps and many more!!!! ."
Negetive,Buy samsung. Not worth for 60hz in 2022 . Boycott apple products . This is a below standard phone with huge notch .
Positive,Performance-??????????Sound Quality-??????????All other ??????????
Positive,"Overall great value for money considering the long future run of usage when compared to Android(have been using One plus devices since 2017).Performance is good. If you are thinking within good price and in the aspect of long run, then I suggest you to go for this."
Positive,Thinking of buying it for many years but avoided due to its high price… finally bought it and satisfied with the product.Mainly missing the normal headphone jack.
Positive,I was an android user. And I never thought that I would be able to switch to IOS but after I did I am liking it. It’s no different than android. Still there are few things where IOS is better.
Positive,"Battery life is good, camera quality is good, touch response is fabulous no lagging while playing games at all, I have switched from android to ios its good..!!"
Positive,"Hangs a little, ui can be cleaner. Camera is bonkers. Good durability, phone was dropped with a normal case multiple times and nothing happened"
Positive,It is a great and happy feel to be a part of apple now from android. A very excellent phone. Superb picture quality nice battery life but no finger sensor. Amazing mobile so far.
Positive,"I thought upgrading from 11 to 13 would be a hassle. I could transfer all my data from 11 to 13 very easily, Never even had to connect to a pc  or download an app."
Positive,I have always been an android user. But boy I was impressed with iPhone 13. The smoothness the phone offers is unmatchable !
Positive,Superb
Positive,"The Apple iPhone 13 (256GB) in Pink offers a combination of elegant design, solid performance, and advanced features. Here’s a detailed review:### Design and BuildThe iPhone 13 in Pink sports a sleek and refined design with flat edges, a ceramic shield front cover, and aerospace-grade aluminum edges. The Pink color option is soft and subtle, making it an attractive choice for those who prefer a pastel look.

Whether you’re streaming videos, browsing photos, or playing games, the display offers a rich visual experience.

Whether you’re multitasking, gaming, or using resource-intensive apps, the device handles everything smoothly. The 256GB storage variant provides ample space for apps, media, and files, making it a good option for users who require more storage.### CameraThe dual-camera system features a 12MP wide and a 12MP ultra-wide lens. The cameras perform exceptionally well in various lighting conditions, producing detailed and vibrant photos. The improved low-light performance and Night mode make it possible to capture clear images even in dim settings. The new Photographic Styles feature allows for customization of the tone and color of your photos without compromising on the overall quality.### Battery LifeThe iPhone 13 offers improved battery life compared to its predecessor. With moderate use, the device can easily last a full day on a single charge. The introduction of smart data modes, which switch between 5G and LTE depending on your usage, also helps in conserving battery.### SoftwareRunning on iOS 15, the iPhone 13 brings a range of new features and enhancements, such as Focus mode, redesigned notifications, and improved FaceTime capabilities. The user interface is smooth and intuitive, making it easy to navigate through apps and settings.### Additional Features- **5G Connectivity:** Offers faster download and upload speeds, improving the overall browsing and streaming experience.- **MagSafe Compatibility:** The device supports MagSafe accessories, allowing for easy attachment of chargers, wallets, and other accessories.- **Water and Dust Resistance:** The iPhone 13 is rated IP68, meaning it can withstand being submerged in water up to 6 meters for 30 minutes.### ConclusionThe iPhone 13 (256GB) in Pink is a solid choice for those looking for a stylish and powerful smartphone. It combines top-tier performance with a beautiful display, excellent camera capabilities, and long battery life. While it may not be a massive upgrade for users of the iPhone 12, it still offers enough enhancements to be a worthy investment for those using older models or wanting the latest features."

Positive,Apple phone are expensive as compared to android but trust me guys its worth each penny.
Positive,Nice phone. Future update proof for next 3 years.
Positive,Like the display Ava camera quality
Negetive,"Just but iphone 12!It’s not worth the money!Unless ur from BJP or something where you’re full with corrupt money, then go ahead."
Positive,"you really don't need to upgrade if you bought a new iPhone last year. But anyone with an iPhone 11 or older will find enough new parts and features to consider the new modelsScreenThe screen is notably better than last year's. It's the first iPhone with Apple's ProMotion display, a very high refresh-rate screen technology that was introduced on the iPad Pro in 2017.The screen can adjust to the content on the page to help save battery life and make things feel smoother. If you're just reading a website, for example, it might refresh less frequently and save battery life. But then if you're gaming or scrolling through a long webpage, it'll refresh really fast to make everything much smoother.BatteryBattery life is top-notch and lasts longer than any other iPhone on the market. Unless you're playing games for hours and hoursThat's thanks to a combination of a newer processor, a new screen and a bigger battery. I streamed nine hours of movies, for example, with just over 50% brightness, and still had more than half the battery left.CameraThe regular wide-angle, the zoom and the ultra-wide-angle lenses on the back now allow in more light, which means they're better at taking pictures in the dark.The HDR feature is also better in situations where your subject might have a lot of light behind them, which can normally make people in a picture look dark — all the iPhone 13 phones can keep color and detail even if the sun is right behind someone.You can get really close to an object, like a blueberry or a flower, and capture a lot of detail."
Positive,I do not have money that I can get a phone but I have a dream to get a phone which will definitely be fulfilled one day
Positive,Pretty Pink Color with amazing features apple has added to the new phone!Feels very light while holding the phone!Happy customer ??
Positive,"I have no money to buy this ph , i am poor guy, kind hearted person can gift a i phone any model no problem . May god bless you ????????"

Positive,Good
Positive,Save money and buy this phone. You will not regret later. Smooth experience.
Positive,Everything about this device is perfect!
Positive,This is very much first time I am using an Iphone and my experience is very good until now. UI is very seamless and lag free but yes sometimes i noticed app crashing or getting refresh in background. Camera quality is superb especially for videography. Night photos are ok but can still see grains while taking photo in low light situation.
Positive,Apple never disappoints with its brand value. I had a great experience using their product. Thanks to Amazon for the same-day delivery.
Positive,"i dont need to explain about the feature it an  ""iPHONE""  name is enough.Amazon super fast delivery, activated the phone got full 1 yrs warranty.super fluid amazing speed nothing more to say."

Negetive,no words
Negetive,"I thought iphone is famous for its camera and touch.Camera is good(not awesome), but touch doesnt seem to be smooth. I dont know i received faulty product.After 2 days of usage, battery is not so good, drains very fast without even using.Only 2 days feels boring.Good things are it has apple logo and face id is super and its accessories are expensive :)If your a android user with a good phone, most likely you will hate this product.And once bought you cant return the product. For any issues contact Apple service center.So if you have money and ready to buy new one next year go ahead and buy this"
Negetive,Amazon ?? ??? ???? ????? ????? ??? ?? ????? ???? ?? ???????? ?? ??? ???? ??? ?? ??? ???? ???? ??? ?? ??? ????? ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ??? ?? ???? ??????? ???
Negetive,"Back minor scratch ,not a big problem but we have paid full amount , this is the only issue  ."

Negetive,Everything is good except cost is getting increased 1k in daily basis on republic day offers it starts from Rs 59*** to now Rs 61**** only
Negetive,Daily use not recommended. It's new scam of iPhone and there service enter. Old ipone is much better than new one
Negetive,Camera is ok charging speed is very slow even with 12 watt charger if your shifting from andriod in my opinion it’s not worth it
Negetive,Very costly phone. It is heating very randomly also. Buy Samsung m53. It has nice front camera quality And ?? ??.
Negetive,"I had a bad experience….My unlock button is not working properly, at times it’s not unlocking my phone. I bought the phone from India on the first week of its launch."
Negetive,Poor camera quality cam
Negetive,"I bought Iphone 13 this battery is not good as other I phone’S battery.I am using I phone,s from long ago. My I phone 11 battery is still good as 13."
Neutral,Battery life is not good and it is draining like anything. We need to charge daily twice. Hence i don’t recommend to buy who is looking for battery life. Another thing is neither manufacturer nor Amazon is not willing replace or return this product
Neutral,Isme koi shak nhi ki apple ka mobile sabse best hai but itne costly mobile ki itni cheap packing maine sapne me bhi nhi socha tha. Packing by amazon so cheap and not in safe style plz amazon send in safe packing when costly and breakable product orders
Negetive,"Like,courier agent was desappointed me. My order is is under exchange bit at the tine of delivery, the agent said that my existing phone not qualified for exchange. He rejected my phone and he go back on"
Negetive,Not easy to use
Negetive,Screen blink kar raha hai aur return ka koi option nahi de raha hai
Negetive,"I switched to ios from Android and being my first experience, I didn't find anything exciting. After trying to settle down for two weeks , i had enuff and finally decided to sell off the phone.Apple doesn't even provide u small things like fonts or themes but then allows third party apps to do so.So basically apple wants you to sell your kidney first to get the phone and then sell other parts also to change font etcMy 11x has much better wifi connectivity than iphone 13.. camera is ok nothing to say 'wow' about.Overall an overrated phone and too pricey.. happy to switch back to Android."
Negetive,I love iPhone 13
Negetive,I received product and product is ok but box barcode label is. Streched not showing properly.
Neutral,Twise a day charging
Neutral,lekin battery thodi kam chalti hai baki koi problem nahi hai only battery problem . koi heavy use nahi karte fir bhi battery drop ho jati hai health 100percent hai
Negetive,"I bought an iPhone 13 on October 13,2023 . Unfortunately, I have encountered issues with it heating up and hanging frequently. This appears to be a local model. Overall I'm disappointed with it's performance, and please don't buy iPhone from Amazon ..."
Negetive,At first so excited  to take an iPhone.. Which went in vein.. Heating issue while charging.. Lag In every app.. I have no pros to say.. Even after updates
Neutral,When I received phone the seal was all ready Brocken and the box looks like very old. Inside product is ok but I saw some others experience for the same seller. They also got the same Brocken seal box.
Negetive,Battery decreased continuously
Negetive,It hangs to much
Neutral,Very good but costly
Neutral,Item. It's good but. Miner screen scratched But not feel scratched And can't feel but a new product  other wise all right
Neutral,IPhone was All Good - Only I had issue with Packing the Box was very poorly maintained - Packing needs to be better when you order 60k IPhone.
Negetive,"Received defective item , not getting option for replacement,Getting totally waste of money & daily visiting apple store now."
Negetive,"I will check with apple store, if shipment found wrong i will see u in court"
Negetive,Within 2 months facing issue

Negetive,Not good. Poor battery...
Negetive,Bad experience
Negetive,Mobile Phone is Okey but USB Data Cable not good as you provide inbox ??
Negetive,Within 10 days sim is not detecting
Negetive,"Its been a month since i got this phone, and i have been changing the charging cable and the adapter, non of them resolve the issue. And the most sad part is im far away from the nearest Apple service centre. To get there i have to get flight. Apple support cant do anything. Its manufacture defect, they are not willing to exchange the product either. Its apain in ass. To get my charged, i have to sit next to it."
Neutral,I doubt the orginality of the product. Unable to click.good picture. Sound is good.. but functionality wise not at all useful.
Negetive,Seal was broken of phone box
Neutral,Best phone ever in this rate
Negetive,"This is just a brick. Cannot be used for calling or internet access unless you have wifi. This device has serious network issues. My One Plus 9 Pro and Realme 7 shows 100% network bars and internet work fast enought to stream multiple HD videos at the same time (speed test result 45mbps - airtel postpaid). But this apple device shows only 1 bar and sometimes none. You can't do anything other than just looking at phone. I kept 9 pro and iphone 13 at the same place at the same time having airtel postpaid sim card inserted. OnePlus gets full coverage of same network while iPhone gets only 1 bar coverage which cannot be used for anything. When I checked online, found that a lot of people facing same network issue with iPhone 13 series. Seriously, I would not recommend anyone to buy this brick."
Negetive,Bahut zada hang ho raha battery health bhi kam ho raha bahut jaldi mai suggest karunga aap iPhone 14 buy karo
Negetive,Mobile heat and battery 93% just in 1 month.. Kindly contact me how to change product
Negetive,They fooled us with the exchange option. I entered the correct imei number of the phone which I want to exchange and when the delivery boy came and checked the exchange option at that exchange option did not worked. He entered the code to verify the exchange but verification failed everytime. We both checked that imei number was correct but verification failed. They fooled us.
Positive,"Great camera , Good sound quality , super screen and good battery life."
Positive,Very good but slightly heating but not very much good worth for money
Positive,Using I phone 13 for past few days.My honest reviewPros:Battery back up is good and improved.you could get easily for a compete day with moderate usageScreen quality is good and comparable to Super AMOLED display.Cons:Screen refresh rate is very low may be @ 60 hz which will strain your eye while scrolling on the web pages and apps which is not good from the price point.Even basic android mobiles will give this and this is not at all acceptable for an iPhone which is major con.Charger is not given in the box and need to be purchased additionally which is also not good at this price point.At least Charger and branded ear pieces have to be given along with box pack.Apple has to improve in these areas.
Positive,"Good packaging and seal box delivery, red color looks amazing, but don't buy with exchange offers!!"
Positive,"Great product in 50,500 rsUsing it feels great , also social confident, andDreamIn today’s , world 1st dream of the people is to have an iphone!Soon will upgrade to 15 pro !"
Positive,Everything is perfect ??Camera 5/5Display 5/5Battery ?? 5/5Call quality 5/5Looks 5/5For me IPhone 13 is good deal than IPhone 15
Positive,"It’s my first time using an iPhone and I’m loving it, totally worth the money for me, got it for just 37k in the great Indian festival sale (7k reduced by exchange including the exchange bonus of 3500 and the credit card discount of 2250)"
Positive,Good
Positive,It's a very good phone and got a good deal on Amazon. I personally picked the 13 over the 14 as there are hardly any differences between the two. The difference I felt is not worth paying 20-30% additional. Overall the 13 does everything well that is expected of an iPhone.
Negetive,"Hi there,My iPhone 13 has problem regarding mic and signal dropsI had iPhone xs before never had this issue, after using iPhone 13 I got so many complaints about my voice getting drop during callOk camera quality"
Negetive,I have bought this phone on 4th may within 2 weeks phones touch got complaint I don't know why we are buying the product with these huge amount of money and we are not getting a minimum guarantee for the product so sad Amazon for the purchase
Negetive,My keys are not working
Negetive,Some isues happening
Negetive,the iphone camera has been forged. it was not ever good compared to the other iphones like iPhone 12 and 13 that i could see from my friends mobile. i guess they have changes the camera lens in some product.
Negetive,Buying an apple product could be a worst decision ever to take.
Negetive,Defective products
Negetive,Bad experience got new phone with defected camera lens with tampers. And Amazon is not ready to replace my phone direct and asking to contact with apple customer care for getting defect mentioned job sheet.
Negetive,Battery life is worst . Even normal use call whatsapp battery drain fast 1 day backup only . Don't go for iphone 13 if u want battery backup. And Android user don't go for iOS lot of disadvantages are there. And don't waste money. U can go for higher range Android.
Negetive,"Seems to be looks like Apple but performance is very Worst, Too much heat and Hanging Always."
Neutral,Selfie camera is not good....  Yellowess photo generate from selfie...  I was sell because selfie is not bright and beauty face....
Neutral,"Bettery life is good, camera is average, i think iphone 15 is a best choice."
Negetive,"I purchased an Apple 13 from Amazon. The phone does not charge and while it charges it charges it vibrates. There is no waranty  in the box. I am trying to contact a service centre, but the service centres say that since you have purchased it from Amazon you have to contact Amazon. Kindly let me know how do I get a warranty and who to contact for service of the phone"
Neutral,Except camera its a dumb Phone.
Negetive,Battery no work Battery backup only 2 hours phone is comfortable but is not work isliye phone no lijiye koi v
Negetive,"I don't recommend others to purchase this phone on online offers, they sell you in less price but the quality of accessories they give you with is phone is compromised. Charging get damaged within 6 months from purchase."
Neutral,Amazon is not providing open box delivery that major disadvantage of purchasing product from amazon apart from this all are good
Neutral,Don't buy mini iPhone even regular iPhone 13 battery is so bad and its draining so fast even if your not using and its not old enough its my newly device I bought this on 19 jan 2023 today is 20 Jan 2023 I face this issue maybe my unit fault or ios 16.02  better upgrade to max models if you have enough penny otherwise don't waste it buy any android device for better specs and all the useful feature you'll get under 60k and one more thing you'll get bored in a single day if you switch Android to ios by the way its my personal opinion maybe someone has different about it thank you !!
Negetive,Network issue in new phone and screen has cracks
Positive,Product is good only thing is Amazon delivery is poor
Positive,I’ve received refurbished item in summer sale.Apart from above comment - iPhone 13 is awesome phone .. Value for money at this price.
Positive,"Absolutely original, received brand new i phone 13, go for it."
Positive,"This phone won’t disappoint you in any aspect,whether it’s the battery life,performance or the cameras but what you might miss is a 120hz screen or perhaps a telephoto lens but if those things do not concern you then there’s actually no reason for you to not buy this, it’s the best phone if you can get it for under 50k,period."
Positive,Exchange of the product was not working
Positive,Loved it and price is best in sale.
Positive,Nothing
Positive,Nice phone and nice performance all over is good in phone ?? comparison to14 better than the 13
Positive,"overall phone is good but my device got issue, auto restart , had to go service centre and now it is fine but that was not expected , maybe software bug issue but had to visit service centre 3 days for that rest is fine"
Positive,"The iPhone 13 both giveth and taketh what the iPhone 12 gave it to work with. Yes the battery, camera, and storage is way better. That much is true. But the build quality? It's hit and miss. Reception Is meh but that could be the SIM card. I've had budget android phones that get full LTE reception where my 13 will have one bar. But again that could just be my SIM card on it's way out. Something about certain aspects of the phone feel much cheaper than bits of it's predecessor. For example the rear glass. Yes it's supposedly the same ceramic shield from the 12 but I've found it scratches much easier for no real reason. Another example is the speaker grille in the front notch. It looks alot cheaper and sounds that way too than the one in the 12. Pretty tinny and just rattley sounding. It's not a horrible phone. It's the first iPhone I've felt like I can get android style utility from. But the questionable build quality changes over the previous generation just stifle it for no reason. That's not to say the phone is entirely built out of meh. For example the camera lenses and the bump are much bigger on the new 13. I work as a mechanic and subjected my old 12 to the same rigors. The 12 took it like a champ aside from very light camera lenses scratching. I've subjected the 13 to much more stress and it just shrugs it off aside from the seemingly unexplainable rear glass scratches. I haven't dropped it like my 12 yet so theres always that. But if it's anything like the 12 it'll take a few hip height falls onto concrete with no issue. I'd be so bold as to call this the ""sweet spot"" for the whole iPhone lineage. good focus on where it matters. Very few compromises."
Positive,SUS
Positive,"Bought the iPhone 13 from Amazon and it's everything I expected and more. Sleek design, powerful performance, excellent camera, and seamless integration with other Apple devices. Fully satisfied and highly recommend it."
Positive,It's first time I ever purchased an iPhone online I was a bit worried what if i gets a refurbished or pre activated phone but nvm it's all good. Thank you! Definately you can go for it?? I would recommend
Positive,Luv the phone and the camera is awesome
Positive,So beautiful so elegant just looking like a wow
Positive,"I am writing this review after 10 days of using this phone. Now i can relate why no one wants to leave iPhone after using it once. Similarly i never want to switch back to any android phone ever. Thank you amazon for a one day delivery. Reflexive touch, vivid display, amazing camera quality and much more."
Positive,This is my first try iPhone. I had this long time dream of possessing an iPhone atleast once in my lifetime. And it finally got fullfilled. Thanks a lot Amazon ??????
Positive,Product is bang on but the box was a bit damaged in the corners
Positive,Previously I was using top of the line android phone like oneplus 8 pro ..but after migrate to apple eco system with iPhone 13 Im mesmerised with the cameras and video quality like DSLR ..and Unbelievable battery life with 7-8 hours SOT with a full day heavy use .. Now I relise Apple is ??
Positive,"Purchased this phone (128 GB version) from Amazon with exchange of one plus 2. With citibank credit card discount, exchange offer, I got it at 67K. Got delviered within 24 hours from Amazon and received original phone. Immeidately checked serail number in Apple website and warranty is geniuine and got it for 1 year.1) Phone will be avaialable with only cable. No adapter.2) Purchased adaptor at Rs.1899 from Amazon. That is also genuine product.3) After using 24 hours, my charge reduced from 100% to 42 %. Good battery.4) Apps  will donwload superfast.5) At the time switching on Iphone will ask for data back up. Please chooose Andriod to Iphone backup and you have to dowload one app in oyur old andriod phone. Iphone display code whcih has to be entered in the app in andriod phone. All contacts, sms, googe drive will automatically transferred to iphone. So easy !6) So far it is good going. Learnig lot...will post you after using few weeks"
Positive,"I have seen that many Amazon users have been skeptical about purchasing iPhone from Darshita ezone or Darshita electronics. After I ordered the product red iPhone 13 from Darshita ezone, because of these negative reviews, even I got scared. However, I didn't cancel my order and decided to wait. Though Amazon delivered the order little late than I expected, I have received a genuine iPhone 13 product red. I checked the model number and IMEI number. All are perfect. Have been using the phone for almost 3 weeks now. Even updated to iOS 17. It's a gem. No issues. No problem. Heating is understandable during charging. But that's already expected. Thumbs up to both Amazon and Darshita ezone. And do I need to write about iPhone 13? It's awesome already."
Positive,I am moving from Android to ios for the first time. It is been a marvelous experience to use iPhone. I regret now for being an android user. First of all the speed what they have mentioned as lightening speed yes i have experienced the lightening speed. Anything u share in whatsapp or any app u open it opens up in a flash. When I put the phone on charging it sometimes over heat the phone but now i have identified the reason for it too. Do not use the phone When on charging leave it untouched so that it won't over heat. No sort of pauses aur hanging issues at all.
Positive,It was a good phone basically I thought that the phone will in damaged conditions or refurbished phone or some of the featured list will low and i was afraid of that but it was all ok and i am happie about that and i bought it in great indian sale
Positive,I'm not a iPhone person but red colour is mine ?? my first iPhone purchase so I love camara quality ?? so happy with iPhone 13 ??
Positive,The phone is smooth and less engaging and in gaming it super fast but lowers brightness while. Need an automatic brightness button to switch off
Positive,Ok guys we get orginal productColour is red128 gbCharging cable is original as both code are matchingPacking was worst no bubble wrapDelivery assistance was very rudeDon't agree to shoot video of opening parcelAmazon is giving permission to do that but delivery agent was rejecting itKindly improve package wrap some bubble cover
Positive,Such a nice product and seller also before receiving order I am scared about the product and seller but both are good and nice thanks Amazon and the seller
Positive,"I was a Android user after several years I'm buying iphone , Was very sceptical of online ordering I mean the costly items but to my surprise everything went so smooth and very happy with the order. I got best offer and very cheap also got my fav colour red. all I want to say is if you want to get it this is the best time iphone 14 not worth the price if u have older phone jst go to iphone 13 or 15 next year. Amazon op"
Positive,Great camera and good perfomance. Only issue is glare in night time videos due to light sources.Battery life is also good
Positive,"In love with the product ,Red Colour is just amazing .Got this for less price in great Amazon festival .Value for money , enjoying luxury & apple legacy ."
Positive,"It is an amazing phone, the entire experience is buttery smooth although the battery is a slightly let down but cannot complain much as it has come a long way since the older iphones, it manages to give a day’s battery life with 6-7 hours screen time which is decent (depending upon how you wanna use your phone, i use mine primarily for work, emailing, googling, watching videos and all). The camera is actually great especially the video quality is wow, this is my switch from android to ios for the first time, although there are a few restrictions in terms of customisation and all but otherwise the phone is great, total value for money (got it for 62k)"
Positive,"I have been using IPhone 7 for nearly 4 years and finally decided to switch to IPhone 13. Now it’s been like nearly six months I been using this phone and I couldn’t really find a real drawback what do ever.Camera is the best. I am not exaggerating, it is better than the entry level DSLR’s. Performance, battery life, sound, display - I am so impressed.The only drawback I could see is phone is slightly heating up while playing games or charging.But it’s still worth a buy."
Positive,Worthy of Money
Positive,After using almot 6 month this phone is running smooth as new one there is some network issues with this phone but although overall you can buy it-MG
Positive,Such a great app

Positive,Good quality features ??
Positive,"What do you want to hear about iPhone,if you are reading this review,it means that you have already done enough research to buy it.so, congratulations for your new iphone??"
Positive,Do I need to write a review for iPhone ?People still gonna buy it anyway.Little bit disappointed from macro lens otherwise who criticize Apple.

Positive,"iPhone 13 is like wow , I have updated from my iPhone SE 2020 to 13 and then I’m feeling like wonderful.the phone camera is 4.5 out of 5 .Multitasking is very easy and thanks to Amazon for secure packaging."
Positive,"You don't need to explain how good apple products are. My earlier iPhone was SE 2020, which worked very well. I exchanged my iPhone SE 2020 with this iPhone 13 and the phone is a wonder. Everything is flawless, speed, performance, face-ID speed.. Just perfect!!"
Positive,I like the colour and battery capacity
Positive,Great buy

Positive,First iPhone and really good experience.Camera Awesome!Battery Awesome!Overall Awesome!
Positive,awesome deal
Positive,"Iphone 13 is as good as iphone 14 , same specifications but different names, but it is not a better phone than iphone 15 ??, some ppl consider camera performance to compare it with iphone 15 , those things are fake ??"

Positive,Excellent
Positive,This looks professional colour and perfect??. Nice product.
Positive,Got this on a amazing deal. If it fits in your budget one should surely get it. Worth the price
Positive,"The biggest improvement I have noted is the battery life. It’s really good. Upgraded from my 7 plus after 4.6 years. Another thing I like is MagSafe charging. One of the main issue I face with my old phone was charging port failure due to dust accumulation. MagSafe charge helps from above said issue. Of course we have to pay for that extra. Even though am enjoying bigger battery ,the thickness increased a bit and it is bit annoying. My advice is it’s a highly paid model, so use it minimum 3 years."
Positive,Nothing different than offline purchase. Same as you see as the title say's. Nothing more to write.Happy Diwali !!
Positive,Nice product good for use in this range good iPhones battery life is a concern beside this everything is good

Negetive,Not able to set up phone because it is stuck in software updates. We have tried many times but problem remain same. We have requested for replacement but supplier shows no stock.
Negetive,"Display flickering at the time of  ringtone change and when playing songs with full volume dear friends Amazon replacement policy of Apple products are very verst they simply provide you Apple service centre adress i complain Amazon to replace after couple of hours after receiving of delivery but they are not ready to do so, so please don't go Apple products with Amazon."
Negetive,I have ordered one apple i phone 13 256 GB After getting the product it shows some abnormal battery behaviour. After that i tried many times to connect customer service but they are rejecting my call. I spent a huge amount for this product but now i can not replace this item even when the product is not good and its battery life is really bad
Negetive,The phone is lagging. I don’t know why?Also it becomes hot while charging.
Negetive,"UTTER WASTE OF MONEY!! After few days of usage, the phone kept turning off repeatedly. It's better to buy iPhone from an authentic Apple showroom."
Negetive,Using  continuously  2 year and after updated screen is white facing problem and not working  service centre is delhi and away from my home town .
Negetive,Mine is one and half yrs old and after update this is the condition.. Check internet there are so many people with same prob and apple doesnt do anything regarding this software prob.. Replacing screen cost 20k
Neutral,"There is clearly mentioned that country of origin from CHINA. But I don't know all the apple product coming from China,or else only amazone sell ,becouse other online sellers clearly mension about country of orgin india. however iam realy confused about which one is real .So now you see want buy or not."
Negetive,Week signal s
Negetive,"Recently I have purchased I phone 13, on 14.10.2023 After 22 Days I'm facing charging issue, phone doesn't charge by the original apple adaptor and lighting cable,After visiting, the apple authorised service center ""Apple Authorised Service Provider - NGRT Systems, Ambuja Mall, Raipur"" on 28.11.2023,Technician said it is physically damaged due to it retains moisture from Air Conditioner, and it will cost Rs. 34000/- for repairing and more than 25 days it will take to repair in Banglore,  is the Apple product is this much sensitive?And also chipped phones glass protector in the 15 minutes of their inspection.As a customer it was my dream to have an Apple product. the service provider and the product was ruined my 1st iphone experience."

Negetive,I have order this phone before 3 weeks and the camera lens’s outer silver coating is already peeling off so pls help me to sort this issue
Neutral,"Bought  the iPhone  for first time, used it for two weeks  I felt my last phone Redmi k20 pro is much better than this phone in comparison with performance,  I love mac books from apple but , this iPhone is overrated"
Neutral,"Apple should increase performance of device, I can say garbage collection is not working as like previous iOS versions. Applications are getting hang some times if ram is consuming more memoryCamera quality should increase for iphone 13 if we compare with samsung mobiles like s21 and s22Even as I observed mobile is heating up but not frequentlyOverall I can say 2.5/5"
Negetive,The delivery boy demanded Rs.500/- and after that only exchanged the phone
Negetive,Hangs a lot. Not worth the hype
Negetive,"My phone stopped working within a month. It was giving nice battery back up, cameras were good everything was fine then suddenly one day phone starts heating, It was so hot that i was unable to touch it at the same time battery was also draining very fast 1% in every 10 seconds. Then eventually phone became dead. Today I left the phone at service center and I am not sure whether issue will be resolved or not. But it was a very bad experience buying an apple product first time. I don't know it happens with only online products or offline products too. But really feeling disappointed today.. Apple is not apple anymore."
Negetive,Charg karne me problam aa rahi he .usb cable saport nahi kar rahi he.
Positive,"Okay so talking about the phone, before the delivery i was worried about the product as i saw there were not many reviews from other buyers about the seller.. But delivery went well and i got the iPhone.No lies the phone is so far good but there's a catch when i unboxed the package the iPhone box had some dirt on it not too much but it was there then inside the box there was the phone which had some of dust particles on it i don't know how but the phone was sealed packed!!Now talking about the phone it's nice and it's been just one day of having it.. Will write a full review after a longer usage then conclude my thoughts on it but ya phone looks and feel in Starlight color is very premium. From switching Android to IOS it's bit a different feel can't explain that but yaa it'll take time to adjust."
Positive,Battery issue
Positive,"Great product.. I love android and apple both, both have different characters I see. When it comes to iphone 13, I love the camera( great pictures), sound(like a surround sound), software, quality, smoothness etc it offers and with style and premiumness. It's not only about the style but really and honestly, overall the product is great. One should use it and realize how great and satisfying this brand and product is.. Great brand.. Go fot it if you could, you'll not regret.."

Positive,"As a first time iPhone user, I was very confused to buy this iPhone 13 or 12 though price difference is manageable…so after all reviews and conclusion I went for iPhone 13 and now after one month usage I can say I have made very right choice. Works very well for me. Be it camera, battery , display. Everything is just perfect…after all it’s an iPhone. And I am moderate user.. so I don’t play heavy games on this device..hence with normal usage it gives me approx 1.5 days battery back up. Hope it helps to choose the right phone for you :-)"

Neutral,Thank You So Much ?????? Amazon
Neutral,Charging adopters not received
Negetive,I bought i phone 13 and within 6 months the display stopped working.  There is not even a scratch on the phone Neither I did any software update  . The display became black automatically and not working . Go and buy offline . This is worst .
Negetive,Good phone from apple but amazon running big scam here by offering extra exchange discounts. Just don't believe in that it's a big SCAM. delivery guy will find minor faults of your device even tho it's fine for exchange and they'll definitely reduce price as low as possible to decrease the price of your exchange.
Negetive,Don’t buy any one this is device is getting very high heat
Negetive,Adopter works only 20 days when warranty time is done
Negetive,"This was my first iPhone purchase and it was working fine for 1.5 years - although I had complains about the battery life which kept getting worse with time to the point that I had to carry a power bank with me always.Randomly one day out of the blue, the phone crashed & now it's not turning on - when I took it to the service centre they said it's due to motherboard issue and it will cost us 40k to replace it. My phone is prime condition, I have not dropped it, there is not even a scratch on it. I wonder how there can be a hardware issue while it was working fine just few moments before crash. Also, this happened a few days after I installed iOS 17 - so that is also a suspect."
Negetive,"battery poor,build quality ok,battery very poor"
Neutral,overall good product but somewhere price sucks and when you realise charger and earphone need to buy separately you cry alot.battery - 3 starcamera -  3 starperformance- 4 startcrowd attention- 5 star
Negetive,"After one year,, green line came. Display problem"
Negetive,"It is a brand new phone and it is overheating a lot during charging, video calls, regular phone use. This is not expected from a brand new phone. My advise to everyone would be please please please don’t buy this product from Amazon/seller. It is much better to buy from the store itself. It is definitely defective or from very old stock. And Amazon is not allowing for a refund for this product as well. No replace/refund - but option is available. It’s just a way to defraud buyers. Not expected at all. Especially from Amazon."
Negetive,Product ki packing good nhi thi but phone is ok and delivery boy ka behaviour attitude wala tha
Negetive,Seal broken
Neutral,"iPhone is not working properly screen tuch sence is very poor , i thank Amazon has delevery used mobile set"
Negetive,Touchpad is not working properly. Apple is a overrated phone. It has very less options.
Negetive,Spent 70000 rupees trusting that the product will be new and defect free. Bought it for my very old parents and in few days it stopped working. They have given to the apple service center to fix their problem. Very disappointed with the seller for cheating a customer who trusted them and spent their valuable hard earned money to give something special to a very old parent!!! I want to return the product and get a full refund.
Negetive,"Mobile got over heat automatically and turned off. And it is not working. Worst product. Even when it's working, it will hang automatically."
Neutral,"I faced heating issues, bulky not recommended"
Negetive,Phone display not working.Fraud
Negetive,Useless phon never buy this heat n useless camera pls don't buy this is my 1 St i phon bt camera quality is 3 Rd class like old Micromax camera and heat every tym
Negetive,"iam not happy with this product why because charger not provided by apple, this is extra burden to customers, without charger adapter how we can charge, by default adapter should give"
Neutral,Good phone
Negetive,While charging mobile it's getting so hot even while using mobile it's get so much heated
Negetive,Battery power is be very bad need to chat on daily basis without of much use. Zero gaming.
